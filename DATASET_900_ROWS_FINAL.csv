0;Using Bayesian threshold model and machine learning method to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction for ordered categorical traits in fish;"Hailiang Song, Tian Dong, Xiaoyu Yan, Wei Wang, Zhaohui Tian, Hongxia Hu *";"Ordered categorical traits are commonly used in fish breeding programs as they are easier to obtain than continuous observations. However, most studies treat ordered categorical traits as linear traits and analyze them using linear models, which can lead to a serious reduction in prediction accuracy by violating the basic assumptions of linear models. The aim of this study was to evaluate the advantages of Bayesian threshold model and machine learning method in genomic prediction of ordered categorical traits in fish. The study was based on the analyses of simulated data and real data of Atlantic salmon. Ordinal categorical traits were simulated with varying numbers of categories (2, 3 and 4) and levels of heritabilities (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5). Linear and threshold models with BayesA and BayesCp methods, as well as a machine learning method, support vector regression with default (SVRdef) and tuning (SVRtuning) hyperparameters were used to investigate their prediction abilities. The results showed that Bayesian threshold models yielded 2.1%, 2.6% and 2.9% higher prediction accuracies on average for 2-, 3- and 4-category traits, respectively, than Bayesian linear models. Furthermore, SVRtuning produced higher prediction accuracy compared with SVRdef and Bayesian threshold models in all scenarios. For real data, Bayesian threshold models yielded 1.2% higher prediction accuracy than Bayesian linear models, and SVRdef and SVRtuning yielded 3.3% and 6.6% higher prediction accuracies than Bayesian methods, respectively. In conclusion, the use of Bayesian threshold model and machine learning method was beneficial for genomic prediction of ordered categorical traits in fish."
1;Drones in agriculture: A review and bibliometric analysis;"Abderahman Rejeb a , Alireza Abdollahi b , Karim Rejeb c , Horst Treiblmaier d,*";"Drones, also called Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), have witnessed a remarkable development in recent decades. In agriculture, they have changed farming practices by offering farmers substantial cost savings, increased operational efficiency, and better profitability. Over the past decades, the topic of agricultural drones has attracted remarkable academic attention. We therefore conduct a comprehensive review based on bibliometrics to summarize and structure existing academic literature and reveal current research trends and hotspots. We apply bibliometric techniques and analyze the literature surrounding agricultural drones to summarize and assess previous research. Our analysis indicates that remote sensing, precision agriculture, deep learning, machine learning, and the Internet of Things are critical topics related to agricultural drones. The co-citation analysis reveals six broad research clusters in the literature. This study is one of the first attempts to summarize drone research in agriculture and suggest future research directions."
2;A comprehensive analysis of global patent landscape for recent R&D in agricultural drone technologies;"Amy J.C. Trappey * , Ging-Bin Lin, Hong-Kai Chen, Ming-Chi Chen";"The rapid development of information technology, along with advanced wireless communication technologies, has revolutionized the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) in many industries. In agriculture, due to the climate change and the growing global population, causing unprecedented demands and risks on food supplies, intelligent and automatic agricultural technologies are critical needs. UAVs offer a wide range of applications to transform traditional agricultural practices into Agriculture 4.0 that integrates advanced technology to optimize agricultural productivity, sustainability, and efficiency.

3;"Multi-sensor drone survey of ancestral agricultural landscapes at Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico";"Jesse Casana a,* , Severin Fowles b , Lindsay M. Montgomery c , Richard Mermejo d , Carolin Ferwerda e , Austin Chad Hill f , Michael Adler g";"Although aircraft-acquired lidar has proven to be a transformative technology for archaeology in forested regions around the world, drone-acquired lidar systems that could potentially offer higher-resolution imagery at much lower cost remain difficult to deploy in field settings, while the data they produce are prone to large errors and are challenging to process. This paper presents results of a study that employs a new ultra-compact drone-based lidar system, alongside aerial thermal and visible light imaging, to document ancient agricultural landscapes at Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico. We discuss the advantages of this new instrumentation, various approaches to field data collection, and as well as our novel data processing and filtering methods, which collectively offer key methodological advances for archaeological investigations using drone-based lidar. Results reveal extensive remains of a vast system of terraces and stone-built field systems, preserved below the modern pinon-juniper- ? ponderosa forests of the Picuris Reservation and surrounding areas. These findings offer new perspectives on the scale and intensity of past agricultural activities in this highland region of the American Southwest, while demonstrating the power of combining multiple drone-based remote sensing datasets with detailed surface surveys to aid in the discovery, mapping, and interpretation of archaeological landscapes in forested regions."
4;Placement and drone flight path mapping of agricultural soil sensors using machine learning;"Payton Goodrich a,* , Omar Betancourt a , Ana Claudia Arias b , Tarek Zohdi a";"Accurate soil data, which can be collected with agricultural sensors spaced at the half-variogram range, is crucial information for precision agriculture. Drones offer a unique advantage over other existing methods to sample data from soil sensors because of the high density of sensors required to gather spatially granular data to capture soil variability. To determine the placement of sensors within an agricultural field, a novel sequential gap-reduction algorithm that minimizes sensor overlap was developed and used to assign sensor placement for four types of agricultural fields. A genetic algorithm optimized multi-agent flight paths for scanning sensors in a simulated agricultural field using a robust agent-based model. The locations of soil sensors for a simulated 400 m center-pivot irrigation field were used to determine flight paths for swarms of 1-8 drones. Increasing the number of drones in the swarm had a negligible effect on total energy expenditure but reduced the time to scan the sensors from 19 min to less than three minutes. The proposed sequential gap reduction algorithm maximizes the coverage of any arbitrarily-shaped agricultural field with fewer sensors than a grid-based distribution in most cases. The proposed multi-agent flight path mapping can effectively and efficiently generate flight paths for variable numbers of drones to scan all sensors. The framework proposed here can be utilized and expanded for variable rate irrigation, precision application of biological control agents, and smart farming."
5;Mean and turbulent flow characteristics of downwash air flow generated by a single rotor blade in agricultural drones;"Cheng Shouji a , Reza Alidoost Dafsari a , Seung-Hwa Yu b , Yong Choi b , Jeekeun Lee c";"Recently, agricultural drones have been widely used for precise agricultural control. In the case of drone control, improved coverage and reduced drift potential of chemical sprays are of major concern, and this is greatly influenced by the downwash flow characteristics formed by the rotor blades. In this study, the mean and turbulent flow characteristics of the downwash flow generated by a single blade of a four-sided agricultural control drone were quantitatively evaluated. The blade radius used to generate the downwash flow was 370 mm, and the measurement position was normalized using this length. In addition, the rotational speed of the blade was 3000 rpm, and the velocity components were dimensionlessly expressed using the blade tip velocity (VBtip) corresponding to this rotational speed. The velocity of downwash flow was measured using CTA-type hot-wire anemometry with an X-type probe, and data were collected at a sampling rate of 30 kHz for turbulence characteristics analysis. The mean velocity, vorticity distribution, turbulence intensity, and Reynolds stress of the fluctuation velocity were quantitatively measured. From extensive experimental works, it was revealed that a high axial velocity is formed at a specific position (r/Lb = 0.4?0.8) along the blade length. The radial velocity shows an asymmetric distribution in the plane close to the blade, and the tangential velocity is higher in the central part of the downwash flow than in the region of a high axial and negative radial velocity. An asymmetric spiral rotational flow with low axial velocity and low-pressure distribution exists inside the downwash flow due to the shear flow, and the influence of the driving motor almost disappears at the axial position (Z/Lb ~ 1). The averaged mean value of the axial, radial, and tangential velocity components measured at six axial planes and normalized by blade tip velocity (VBtip) is composed of the ratio of the axial velocity component of 12.8%, the radial velocity component of 0.19%, and the tangential velocity component of 1.3%. The maximum values of the turbulence intensity of the axial, radial, and tangential velocity components were estimated as 6.8%, 3.0%, and 4.3%, respectively."
6;Entrepreneurs of the air: Sprayer drones as mediators of volumetric agriculture;"Francisco Klauser * , Dennis Pauschinger";"The article investigates in empirical detail the air-bound practices, expectations and imaginaries that arise from the development and commercialisation of the first authorised drone system in Europe for the automated application of pesticides, which has been developed and sold and is piloted by a Swiss startup company. Sprayer drones make the air relevant for agricultural practices and processes in novel, inherently functionalised and commercialised ways, such is the article?s basic argument. Thus, the aerial realm is being encountered as an object of pragmatically motivated alliances and competitions, which depend on the agendas and organisational structures of the stakeholders involved. This leads to a critical discussion of the issues surrounding the increasing instrumentalisation of the air for agro-entrepreneurial purposes, and opens up a wider reflection on how agriculture relates to the air and, indeed, on how to develop a properly ?volumetric thinking? in contemporary rural studies."
7;Creation of a digital model of fields with application of DJI phantom 3 drone and the opportunities of its utilization in agriculture;"T. Hovhannisyan* , P. Efendyan, M. Vardanyan";"Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of the economy of the Republic of Armenia. About 45% of people employed in Armenia are engaged in agriculture [1]. Innovative technologies, especially unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), can make a great contribution to the development and improvement of agriculture. The purpose of the research was to study the possibilities of application of unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture. We have got digital models of 3 ha fields using DJI phantom 3, and this enables us to receive up-to-date information at any time and carry out a variety of analyzes and projections."
8;Soil sampling with drones and augmented reality in precision agriculture;"Janna Huuskonen, Timo Oksanen?";"Soil sampling is an important tool to gather information for making proper decisions regarding the fertilization of fields. Depending on the national regulations, the minimum frequency may be once per five years and spatially every ten hectares. For precision farming purposes, this is not sufficient. In precision farming, the challenge is to collect the samples from such regions that are internally consistent while limiting the number of samples required. For this purpose, management zones are used to divide the field into smaller regions. This article presents a novel approach to automatically determine the locations for soil samples based on a soil map created from drone imaging after ploughing, and a wearable augmented reality technology to guide the user to the generated sample points. Finally, the article presents the results of a demonstration carried out in southern Finland."
9;Implementation of drone technology for farm monitoring & pesticide spraying: A review;"Abdul Hafeez a , Mohammed Aslam Husain a,* , S.P. Singh a , Anurag Chauhan b , Mohd. Tauseef Khan b , Navneet Kumar c , Abhishek Chauhan c , S.K. Soni d";"The world receives more than 200 thousand people in a day and it is expected that the total world population will reach 9.6 billion by the year 2050. This will result in extra food demand, which can only be met from enhanced crop yield. Therefore, modernization of the agricultural sector becomes the need of the hour. There are many constraints that are responsible for the low production of crops, which can be overcome by using drone technology in the agriculture sector. This paper presents an analysis of drone technologies and their modifications with time in the agriculture sector in the last decade. The application of drones in the area of crop monitoring, and pesticide spraying for Precision Agriculture (PA) has been covered. The work done related to drone structure, multiple sensor development, innovation in spot area spraying has been presented. Moreover, the use of Artificial Intelligent (AI) and deep learning for the remote monitoring of crops has been discussed"
10;Review on Application of Drone Systems in Precision Agriculture;"UM Rao Mogili1* and B B V L Deepak2 ,";"In the present era, there are too many developments in precision agriculture for increasing the crop productivity. Especially, in the developing countries like India, over 70% of the rural people depends upon the agriculture fields. The agriculture fields faces dramatic losses due to the diseases. These diseases came from the pests and insets, which reduces the productivity of the crops. Pesticides and fertilizers are used to kill the insects and pests in order to enhance the crop quality. The WHO (World Health Organization) estimated as one million cases of ill effected, when spraying the pesticides in the crop filed manually. The Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ? aircrafts are used to spray the pesticides to avoid the health problems of humans when they spray manually. UAVs can be used easily, where the equipment and labors difficulty to operate. This paper reviews briefly the implementation of UAVs for crop monitoring and pesticide spraying."
11;The use of drone for rice cultivation in Malaysia: Identification of factors influencing its farmers? acceptance;"Azril Shazwan Azizul, Darius El Pebrian ? , Samihah Mustaffha, Siti Mariam Shamsi, Mohd. Khairy Zahari, Nur Aziera Ruslan";"This study aims to identify factors influencing farmers? acceptance of the use of drone for rice cultivation in Malaysia. A total of 204 farmers who hired custom operator of drone at rice granaries in Kota Bharu Utara district, Kelantan state of Malaysia were selected as the samples in this study. Face-to-face survey technique was employed to collect data form the sampled farmers. Factor analysis was utilized to examine the scaled responses. The findings of this study have successfully identified 15 factors that have correlation with the farmers? acceptance of the use of drone in the study area. However, 2 out of 15 factors, namely ?drone roles? and ?drone handling skill? were highly significant. A rank of these factors was also successfully established from this study. Knowing of these factors is valuable for improving management of the use of drone for rice cultivation that suit to the real-farmers? environment in efforts of achieving economic and technical satisfactions of the field operation."
12;Multifaceted applicability of drones: A review;"Matthew Ayamga a,* , Selorm Akaba b , Albert Apotele Nyaaba";"Technology is playing its part in globalization and the drone technology is such a technology with a usage ever increasing in a vast range of disciplines such as agriculture, health and military. Drones can provide real-time data on farms that enable farmers to make informed decisions regarding farm inputs usage. Also, they can be used to aerially deliver medical supplies like blood, vaccines, drugs, and laboratory test samples during health emergencies to remote areas in developing countries. Military drones also help in security and surveillance on the enemies? movements which then helps select for target killings. Though beneficial, drones can cause injuries and damages to people and properties if the user is not trained and if there is a component failure during flight. Drones could also be hijacked by an extremist and divert the payload for their self-interest. In this paper, the Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis of the current developments of agricultural, medical, and military drones are presented."
13;A trans-theoretical model for the adoption of drones by large-scale German farmers;"Marius Michels* , Cord-Friedrich von Hobe, Oliver Musshoff";"To analyse the adoption of drones in agriculture as the latest tool added to the set of precision agriculture technologies, this paper makes use of a novel application of the trans-theoretical model of behavioural change by analysing a sample of 167 large-scale German farmers collected in 2019. The model provides a gradual measure of farmers decision making with respect to the adoption of drones, which gives more detailed insight into farmers adoption processes than the more common approach of applied binary classifications. Ordinal logit regression results show that, among other factors, farmers age, precision agriculture technology literacy and farm size affect farmers? adoption process. Thus, this paper contributes to the literature by identifying key determinants of the drone adoption process in agriculture. Furthermore, this study provides information about the fields of drone application as well as reasons that oppose the usage of drones by farmers. The results are of interest for policy makers and suppliers of drones."
14;Improved airborne computer system strategy for swarm drones flying based on skybrush suite and inspired technique;"Mohammed Najm Abdullah a,* , Khulood Eskander Dagher b , Sondous Sulaiman Wali a";"In airborne swarm drones, there are a significant impact on daily life as a result of air advances in electronic communications. There are different types of UAVs (Unmanned Air Vehicles) being developed as possible. In this research, the ARDUPILOT or the so-called ARDUCOPTER is simulated as firmware with a MAV link (Micro Air Vehicle Communication Protocol) that is connected to the Skybrush through the communication layer. Where a swarm of drones consisting of 20 drones was studied and 3D displays were created in the drones taking into account the frequency of 2.4 GHz and the distance between the drones to avoid collisions that occur in the paths of the drones by using PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm which happens in the swarm of drones. The trajectory of drone 5493 and a number of ports 9195 were obtained from the proposed system."
15;Virtual Electromagnetic Environment Modeling Based Data Augmentation for Drone Signal Identification;"Hanshuo Zhanga,b,, Tao Lia,* , Yongzhao Lia,* , Zhijin Wenb";"Radio frequency (RF)-based drone identification technologies have the advantages of long effective distances and low environmental dependence, which has become indispensable for drone surveillance systems. However, since drones operate in unlicensed frequency bands, a large number of co-frequency devices exist in these bands, which brings a great challenge to traditional signal identification methods. Deep learning techniques provide a new approach to complete end-to-end signal identification by directly learning the distribution of RF data. In such scenarios, due to the complexity and high dynamics of the electromagnetic environments, a massive amount of data that can reflect the various propagation conditions of drone signals is necessary for a robust neural network (NN) for identifying drones. In reality, signal acquisition and labeling that meet the above requirements are too costly to implement. Therefore, we propose a virtual electromagnetic environment modeling based data augmentation (DA) method to improve the diversity of drone signal data. The DA method focuses on simulating the spectrograms of drone signals transmitted in real-world environments and randomly generates extra training data in each training epoch. Furthermore, considering the limited processing capability of RF receivers, we modify the original YOLOv5s model to a more lightweight version. Without losing the identification performance, more hardware-friendly designs are applied and the number of parameters decreases about 10-fold. For performance evaluation, we utilized a universal software radio peripheral (USRP) X310 platform to collect RF signals of four drones in an anechoic chamber and a practical wireless scenario. Experiment results reveal that the NN trained with augmented data performs as well as that trained with practical data in the complex electromagnetic environment."
16;Drone remote sensing in urban forest management: A case study;"Mia T. Wavrek a , Eric Carr b , Sharon Jean-Philippe c , Michael L. McKinney d,";"We applied drone remote sensing to identify relationships between key forest health indicators collected in the field and four Vegetative Indices (VI) to improve conservation management of urban forests. Key indicators of urban forest health revealed several areas of conservation concern including a majority of overstory trees in moderate to severe decline, canopy gaps, anthropogenic dumping, vines overtaking the forest canopy, and invasion by non-native plant species. We found plot-level vegetation index (VI) values of NDVI, NDRE, GNDVI, and GRVI calculated from drone imagery are significantly related to the impact of several of these ecological concerns as well as metrics of forest composition and equitability. Despite the small number of plots, too few to provide a general predictive framework, these findings indicate a substantial potential for drone remote sensing as a lowcost, efficient tool for urban forest management. We discuss how our findings can advance urban forest management and discuss challenges and opportunities for future drone VI research in urban natural areas."
17;Drone imagery to create a common understanding of landscapes;"Fritz Kleinschroth a,* , Kawawa Banda b , Henry Zimba b,c , Stefaan Dondeyne d , Imasiku Nyambe b , Simon Spratley e , R. Scott Winton";"Negotiated solutions among contrasting land use interests in the nexus of water, energy, food and ecosystems require cooperation between actors with different viewpoints and backgrounds. We suggest aerial imagery and videos, captured by drones, to be ?boundary objects?, easily interpretable landscape representations that might create a common understanding across stakeholders through their universal interpretability. We collected drone imagery and videos from different angles of a wide range of landscapes in Zambia, showing agricultural areas, forests, wetlands and water infrastructure. Then, we took the imagery back to the field to probe the perceptions of multiple stakeholders, including staff from both governmental and non-governmental organizations, hydropower operators, small- and large-scale farmers. In focus group discussions, we assessed the interpretability of oblique images, taken at an angle by a video drone, compared to nadir (vertical) imagery from Google Earth and from a high-end mapping drone. We show that oblique images produced better identification results across all groups of stakeholders, but especially from small-scale farmers, suggesting this type of imagery is helpful to empower people who lack previous experience in interpreting nadir images. Overall, the appreciation of the aesthetic value and the perceived professional benefits of drone imagery are high, but technical and legal barriers impede a wider adoption of the technology. While we highlight ethical concerns and technical limitations, we suggest that conservationists and environmental planners could benefit from a critical use of affordable video drones so as to produce intuitive landscape representations useful for more effective multi-stakeholder collaborations."
18;Research on modelling accuracy and test validation for biomimetic flapping-wing drone;Mingyang Huang;"Scientific advances in drone design have enabled a wide range of services, underpinned by different drones that have various aerodynamic performance. However, research to date is mostly limited focusing on conventional drones. Unconventional drones such as biomimetic drones attracted much attention due to their advantages, including precise point accessibility, altitude manoeuvrability, and no topography restriction for landing. To model the flight dynamics for biomimetic drones, the modelling accuracy is the key indicator to be determined thus, it requires further analysis. After reviewing previous research, this paper develops a more accurate model by using appropriate methods for error mitigation. To reflect the flapping pattern of biomimetic drones, this model adopts an advanced numerical method (i.e., a quasi-steady model) to calculate their aerodynamics. The aerodynamics is also affected by the wind (acting on the drone), determined via wind-generated lift and drag terms. Therefore, this paper develops a combined aerodynamic and wind model applicable to biomimetic drones including flapping-wing drones with the following contributions. Comparative analysis discovers that the difference of drones is unsteady flows thus, a rigorous physical model is built for flow modelling, and its novelty is a quasi-steady method to realistically quantify drone aerodynamics and wind influence. This model is demonstrated by a valid case study of the most stringent application in relation to the motion of a novel flapping-wing drone. The motion simulation of such drone is performed, and then a three-dimensional engineering prototype is built for flight test validation. This case study is implemented and the modelling performance in terms of accuracy is quantified, validating that the new model increases modelling accuracy based on research to date"
19;Synchronized truck and drone routing under disastrous conditions (case study: Urban thoroughfares disinfection);"Hamed Manshadian , Mohsen Sadegh Amalnick * , S. Ali Torabi";"Spraying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely utilized in the agricultural sector for various field operations including irrigation as well as fertilizing and pesticides applications. In this paper, we explore the application of spraying UAVs to neutralize environmental contamination or infections in crises such as outbreak of epidemics. Given the limitations of current UAV technologies and their operational constraints in urban areas, such crisis management operations are carried out in collaboration with ground vehicles. Consequently, a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to facilitate the collaboration of ground vehicles with UAVs. A hybrid heuristic algorithm consisting of simulated annealing and tabu search is also developed to solve the large-size instances efficiently. Finally, the applicability of the model and its solution approach are validated using real-world data."
20;A multiple-drone arc routing and mothership coordination problem;"Lavinia Amorosi a,*,1 , Justo Puerto b,1 , Carlos Valverde";"This paper considers the optimisation problems that arise in coordinating a tandem between a mothership vehicle and a fleet of drones. Each drone can be launched from the mothership to perform a task. After completing their tasks, the drones return to the mothership to recharge their batteries and be ready for a new task. Tasks consist of (partially) visiting graphs of a given length to provide some services or to carry out a surveillance/inspection activity. The goal is to minimise the overall time of travelling carried out by the mothership (makespan) while satisfying some requirements in terms of fractions of visits to the target graphs. In all cases, we develop exact formulations resorting to mixed-integer second-order cone programmes that are compared on a testbed of instances to assess their performance. We also develop a matheuristic algorithm that provides reasonable solutions. Computational experiments show the usefulness of our methodology in different scenarios"
21;Drone Audio recognition based on Machine Learning Techniques;"Giovanni Lacavaa,* , Francesco Mercaldob,a,* , Fabio Martinellia , Antonella Santoneb";"Unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) are widely available on today?s market for use for use both as a hobby and to meet specific industrial needs, such as agriculture or parcel transport. This intensive use in various areas has also led to an increase in the illegitimate and criminal use of them, which has led to an interest in identification and detection techniques in the academic world. To address this topic, we propose a method that automates drone detection processes using their acoustic characteristics with different machine learning algorithms. In this study, we show the advantage of using machine learning techniques for drone detection. Experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed method is promising in drone detection."
22;Current summary of the evidence in drone-based emergency medical services care;"Nathan B. Roberts a, *, Emily Ager a, *, Thomas Leith b , Isabel Lott b , Marlee Mason-Maready c , Tyler Nix d , Adam Gottula a,e , Nathaniel Hunt a , Christine Brent a";"Interventions for many medical emergencies including cardiac arrests, strokes, drug overdoses, seizures, and trauma, are critically time-dependent, with faster intervention leading to improved patient outcomes. Consequently, a major focus of emergency medical services (EMS) systems and prehospital medicine has been improving the time until medical intervention in these time-sensitive emergencies, often by reducing the time required to deliver critical medical supplies to the scene of the emergency. Medical indications for using unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, are rapidly expanding, including the delivery of time-sensitive medical supplies. To date, the drone-based delivery of a variety of time-critical medical supplies has been evaluated, generating promising data suggesting that drones can improve the time interval to intervention through the rapid delivery of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs), naloxone, antiepileptics, and blood products. Furthermore, the improvement in the time until intervention offered by drones in out-of-hospital emergencies is likely to improve patient outcomes in time-dependent medical emergencies. However, barriers and knowledge gaps remain that must be addressed. Further research demonstrating functionality in real-world scenarios, as well as research that integrates drones into the existing EMS structure will be necessary before drones can reach their full potential. The primary aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence in drone-based Emergency Medical Services Care to help identify future research directions"
23;Multiple traveling salesperson problem with drones: General variable neighborhood search approach;"Baybars ?Ibro?skaa , Selin Ozpeynirci ? b , Ozg?ur ? Ozp";"A key factor to consider in the development of new technologies in a number of fields is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles. This rapidly developing technology is used in military, communication, health, mapping, agriculture and transportation fields. The importance of cargo transportation has grown due to the growth of e-commerce. Currently, with advancing technology, and the effect of the pandemic, purchases are increasingly made over the internet. For cargo transporters, this situation leads to an increase in the number of destination points, in distances traveled, and in the delivery frequency, and a decrease in the package sizes. As a result, the planning of transportation has become increasingly complex. One solution is to make greater use of unmanned aerial vehicles in this sector, and to reduce reliance on trucks through appropriate planning. This involves two aspects: the unmanned aerial vehicle delivering to a point, while the cargo truck delivers to a separate point. In this study, we consider a multiple travelling salesperson problem simultaneously using multiple trucks and unmanned aerial vehicles for package delivery. We develop a general variable neighborhood search algorithm, and compare the results with the existing studies in the literature. Computational experiments show that our approach is able to find highly satisfactory solutions in reasonable time, and outperforms the existing methods in terms of best solution, average solution and solution time in majority of the instances."
24;A systematic literature review on the main factors for public acceptance of drones;"Hullysses Sabino a,* , Rodrigo V.S. Almeida b , Lucas Baptista de Moraes b , Walber Paschoal da Silva b , Raphael Guerra c , Carlos Malcher b , Diego Passos c,d , Fernanda G.O. Passos b,";"Drones have become usual among the civilian population and are enabling cities to be more interconnected and intelligent. However, few studies about the public?s opinion on drones have been conducted and those are usually particular for a certain country or region. Knowledge of public opinion is crucial for guiding government policies, particularly on new technologies. This work aims to conduct a systematic review to identify the civilian public attitude toward drones and to assess the main factors that influence opinion. A total of 30 studies were included in the review, analyzing public opinion regarding drones in 15 countries. The review shows that public opinion is influenced by socio-cultural aspects, the main perceived risks and the main expected benefits. Sociocultural factors were related to demographic aspects, such as geographic location, technological expertise, and familiarity with drone-related terminology. The main perceived risks included drone misuse, privacy disrespect, malfunction, damage, safety, noise and legal liability. The main expected benefits, such as application flexibility, emergency response and monitoring, cost reduction and safety, are also described. This review may orient future qualitative and quantitative research on public acceptance of drones and guide researchers and decision makers on drone use by describing the influencing factors on the population?s perceived benefits and risks."
25;An exact algorithm for the two-echelon vehicle routing problem with drones;"Hang Zhou a , Hu Qin a , Chun Cheng b,* , Louis-Martin Rousseau c";"This paper studies a new variant of the vehicle routing problem with drones, i.e., the twoechelon vehicle routing problem with drones, where multiple vehicles and drones work collaboratively to serve customers. Drones can perform multiple back-and-forth trips when their paired vehicle stops at a customer node, forming a two-echelon network. Several practical constraints such as customers? delivery deadlines and drones? energy capacity are considered. Different from existing studies, we treat the number of drones taken by each vehicle as a decision variable instead of a given parameter, which provides more flexibility for planning vehicle and drone routes. We first formulate this problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model, which is solvable by off-the-shelf commercial solvers. To tackle instances more efficiently, we next construct a set-partitioning model. To solve it, an exact branch-and-price algorithm is proposed, where a bidirectional labeling algorithm is used to solve the pricing problem. To speed up the algorithm, a tabu search algorithm is first applied before the exact labeling algorithm for finding desired columns in each iteration of the column generation process. Extensive numerical tests show that our algorithm can solve most instances within 25 customers to optimality in a short time frame and some instances of 35 customers to optimality within a three-hour time limit. Results also demonstrate that the allocation decisions of drones can help save the duration of all routes by 3.44% on average for 25-customer instances, compared to the case of fixing the number of paired drones on each vehicle. In addition, sensitivity analyses show that multiple strategies, e.g., adopting batteries of a higher energy density and developing faster drones, can be applied to further improve the delivery efficiency of a truck?drone system."
26;Optimal waypoint assignment for designing drone light show formations;"Dharna Nar * , Radhika Kotecha";"Advancements in technology and new drone policies have boosted the adoption of drones by various industries. With active research and development, ingenious applications using drones are being developed. One such innovative and creative application of swarm drones is the drone light show. Light shows are generally performed outdoors in a dedicated clear open air space, which attracts the usage of drones for the execution. A fleet of multiple UAVs illuminates the night sky with picturesque performances in a synchronized manner. Use of drones in light shows provides an eco-friendly and reusable alternative for unique ways of advertisements, celebrations, storytelling, and entertainment. To choreograph the performance of swarm drones means allocating waypoints to each drone for every formation and the complexity of designing increases with the number of drones. An intelligent optimal assignment system is much required to allocate waypoints to drones for each transition in order to create formations. We propose a static swarm-intelligence-based assignment approach named Constrained Hungarian Method for Swarm Drones Assignment (CHungSDA) for optimally assigning multi-UAVs to waypoints. This approach uses Hungarian algorithm as a base with added constraints specific to the targeted application. Several simulations of the proposed approach ? carried out for different designs have shown promising results. The work will be of best reference to the UAV manufacturers for their functional design of UAVs and development of Ground Control Station Software to communicate with multiple UAVs, along with other companies that aim to create visual illustrations using UAVs."
27;"A drone hop from the local shop? Where could drone delivery as a service happen in Europe and the USA, and how many people could benefit from it?";"Jean-Philippe Aurambout * , Konstantinos Gkoumas, Biagio Ciuffo";"The rapid technological and regulatory evolution in the field of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV or drones) may soon open the way for their deployment in the last mile delivery of products. This has the potential to decrease delivery costs, reduce transport externalities caused by road traffic and reduce missed-deliveries.

Yet a detailed analysis of the market potential of this system is still only partly available in the literature. To bridge this gap, this paper tries to quantify the proportion of the population, both in Europe and the USA that could benefit from drone-delivery services.

28;Sensor optimization for altitude estimation of spraying drones in vineyards;Thomas Severin * Dirk soffker;"Current drones find a variety of applications, including in viticulture. The application of pesticides in steep slope viticulture is necessary to control pathogens. Due to the characteristics of the applied liquids, high demands are placed on the robustness and reliability of the drone and the selected sensors. For the application of the particle-laden fluid, a specific altitude is useful, which should be realized by a flight attitude control system. Steep slope situations generate increased demands on accurate relative altitude estimation. This study compares various low-cost sensors for ground distance measurement suitable for spray drones. Using the overflight of a vineyard as an example, the problem is demonstrated, sensor data are recorded for evaluation, and suitable parameters and strategies are set. Sensor signals based on ultrasound, range radar, and Doppler radar are filtered using a Kalman filter. Various measures are presented to optimize the estimated altitude to improve the reliability in terms of relative altitude estimation. The presented algorithm will be implemented on a companion computer parallel to the flight controller."

30;Soil properties zoning of agricultural fields based on a climate-driven spatial clustering of remote sensing time series data;"Francesco Reyes a,b , Raffaele Casa a,* , Massimo Tolomio a,c , Michele Dalponte d , Nada Mzid";"The identification of zones within an agricultural field that respond differently to environmental factors and agronomic management is a key requirement for the adoption of more precise and sustainable agricultural practices. Several approaches based on spatial clustering methods applied to different data sources, e.g. yield maps, proximal sensors and soil surveys, have been proposed in the last decades. The current availability of a huge amount of free remote sensing data allows to apply these approaches to agricultural areas where ground or proximal data are not available. However, in order to provide useful agronomic management information, it is essential that the zoning obtained by clustering is linked to the underlying spatial variability of soil properties. In this work we explore the hypothesis that the response of crop vigor to temporal climate variability, assessed by remote sensing data time series, selected to correspond to specific growth phases and seasonal climate patterns, provides indications on the variability of soil properties within agricultural fields, for both herbaceous and tree crops. NDVI time-series for 38 years (1984?2021) were obtained for fourteen non-irrigated herbaceous and tree crop fields in Central Italy, from multispectral satellites data (Landsat 5/7/8, Sentinel 2). The Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was used to classify time series into three climatic classes (dry/ normal/wet) for five different periods of the growth season, covering the main phenological phases. K-means clustering was used to identify patterns of crop growth from climatically classified image sets, as well as for all the bulked images for comparison (bulk clustering). Clustering results were compared with soil maps obtained from spatialized ground data, for soil texture (clay, silt and sand), soil organic matter and available soil water (ASW). The agreement between the different clustering results and soil maps was assessed by the Adjusted Rand Index. Agreement with soil maps varied depending on the field, the phenological phase considered and the soil property considered. Climate driven clustering from long, late growth season periods best matched soil properties, both for herbaceous and tree crops, despite being based on a limited number of images. The clustering from images spanning a longer growth period for dry years systematically outpaced the bulk clustering for silt, sand and ASW, while the clustering for normal climatic conditions was the best for organic matter. The performance of the matching between clustering and soil maps increased with soil variability significantly more (P < 0.05) than in the bulk clustering (mean slopes respectively 0.468 ? 0.167 0.113 ? 0.270). The integration of the SPEI climatic index into the clustering procedure systematically improved the identification of zones with homogeneous soil properties, highlighting that a greater attention should be posed to the climate-crop-field interactions when using remotely sensed images."
31;Integrating sustainability indicators and governance structures via clustering analysis and multicriteria decision making for an urban agriculture network;"Andrea Valencia a , Jiangxiao Qiu b , Ni-Bin Chang a,*";"Environmental, social, and economic sustainability patterns interact in various dimensions of an urban environment. Exacerbated population growth triggers an emphasis on better resource management strategies addressing the balance of supply and demand over food, energy, and water sectors while considering social and economic development. Promoting sustainable development goals requires governance structures and functions within and across the food, energy, and water sectors, specifically due to polycentric urban development. This study emphasizes food security via an urban agriculture network in the greater Miami metropolitan area, encompassing the three counties of Palm-Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade. Given the existing governance structure, we quantified several sustainability indices for clustering analysis to agglomerate urban agricultural sites (UASs) and to help identify the priority of clusters in terms of vulnerability or risk level according to their priority index in multicriteria decision-making. The cases of eight clusters were selected for the visualization of the UASs ranked by multicriteria decision-making based on scenarios prioritized for governance under the impacts of climate change, social equity, and economic development. The role of governance structure was highlighted for signifying the incentive programs to enhance the overall sustainability performance of UASs in an urban food?energy?water nexus"

This research focused on providing energy-efficient software and IoT applications for sustainability. Sustainability is integrating the environmental, social, and economic resources to thrive healthy and different requirements to fulfill human needs simultaneously. It can also be referred to as the maintenance of the environment, especially the natural resources maintaining social equality and economic stability to create a healthy community for this generation and the next generation. For sustainability, this paper proposed a Region-based clustering and cluster-head election model to improve the Energy efficiency of IoT networks deployed in the Agriculture environment (REAN). The proposed methodology uses the Shortest Routing and Less Cost algorithm (SRLC) and Region Clustering and Cluster Head Selection (RCHS) algorithm to provide energy-efficient software and IoT application. The experimental results are used to verify the performance of IoT-based sustainable applications in a real-time environment."
33;Comparing delivery channels to promote nutrition-sensitive agriculture: A cluster-randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh;"Akhter Ahmed a , Fiona Coleman b , John Hoddinott a,b,* , Purnima Menon a , Aklima Parvin a , Audrey Pereira c , Agnes Quisumbing a , Shalini Roy";"We use a randomized controlled trial in rural Bangladesh to compare two models of delivering nutrition content jointly to husbands and wives: deploying female nutrition workers versus mostly male agriculture extension workers. Both approaches increased nutrition knowledge of men and women, household and individual diet quality, and women?s empowerment. Intervention effects on agriculture and nutrition knowledge, agricultural production diversity, dietary diversity, women?s empowerment, and gender parity do not significantly differ between models where nutrition workers versus agriculture extension workers provide the training. The exception is in an attitudes score, where results indicate same-sex agents may affect scores differently than opposite-sex agents. Our results suggest opposite-sex agents may not necessarily be less effective in providing training. In South Asia, where agricultural extension systems and the pipeline to those systems are maledominated, training men to deliver nutrition messages may offer a temporary solution to the shortage of female extension workers and offer opportunities to scale and promote nutrition-sensitive agriculture. However, in both models, we find evidence that the presence of mothers-in-law within households modifies the programs? effectiveness on some nutrition, empowerment, and attitude measures, suggesting that accounting for other influential household members is a potential area for future programming."

Modern IoT-based smart agriculture systems use Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to gather information from an ecosystem that regulates the quantity of water in agricultural fields could be one of these activities. The WSNs remained a challenge to transfer data to drones for analysis purposes. These are composed of tiny sensory architectures organized together to bring efficiency and scalability features to a network. WSN nodes are controlled and managed by a cluster. It is quite difficult to design an efficient leader election protocol. The computation power, storage space, and energy supply of sensor nodes make them unable to frequently switch to a different cluster. The WSN cluster-head election process requires a lot of energy (evaluation and computational process to select the most appropriate node with the least impact on network fragmentation in energy consumption of selected node). Then it is necessary to formulate a mechanism where WSNs utilize the least energy to coordinate with the remote sensing sources. This study presents a cluster election algorithm using the fuzzy logic inference system. It uses a coordinates system to map network nodes and map them based on prioritized scheduling. Lifetime augmentation in wireless sensor networks has always been of great interest. During data transmission from normal sensor nodes to the base station (sink), excess energy is dissipated. Optimizing the energy dissipation of WSNs through the selection of cluster heads is a powerful way to increase the lifespan. By electing more efficient nodes as cluster heads, the proposed method extends the network?s lifetime by reducing the number of unimportant communications between nodes. With the utilization of network resources efficiently, the network?s lifetime is extended. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with the LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Structure) algorithm and FCA method based on the remaining energy and the number of active nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm utilizes less energy for communication with remote sensory equipment for intelligent agriculture. The performance of the method improved for remaining energy by 9%, the"

Agricultural programs have led to increased yields and household incomes but showed limited success in improving nutritional status. Objectives: We assessed whether linear growth could be improved through a potentially scalable, integrated program adding nutritionspecific and nutrition-sensitive components to an existing agricultural program. Methods: In this cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Western Kenya, we randomized children aged 6?35 months from farming families to an agricultural intervention without (control group) or with a bundle of interventions (intervention group), including distribution of micronutrient powders (MNP), poultry to increase egg consumption, seeds of greens and onions, and soap and chlorine solution, as well as provision of monthly behavior change trainings. The primary outcome was the change in height-for-age z-score (HAZ) over 2 years of follow-up. We assessed safety through active morbidity and passive adverse event monitoring. We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis, followed by per-protocol and prespecified subgroup analyses. Results: From March to April 2018, we enrolled 1927 children from 126 clusters (control, 942 children in 63 clusters intervention, 985 children in 63 clusters). Data on HAZ were available for 1672 (86.6%) children after 2 years. Adherence was >80% for use of MNP, chlorine, and greens and receipt of soap, and ~40% for egg and red onion consumption. The intention-to-treat analysis indicated a greater change in HAZ over 2 years in the intervention group (adjusted effect size, 0.11 95% CI: 0.02?0.19). We found a slightly stronger effect in the per-protocol analysis (adjusted effect size, 0.15 95% CI: 0.06?0.24). Dietary diversity and consumption of iron-rich foods were improved in the intervention group, and reported instances of fever, lower respiratory tract infections, and diarrheal episodes were lower in the intervention group"
36;Agricultural clusters and poverty in municipalities in the Northeast Region of Brazil: A spatial perspective?;"Girliany Santos da Silva a , Patr?ia Ara?o Amarante b , Jos?e Carlos Ara?o Amarante c,*";"This article evaluated the spatial distribution of agricultural activity in the municipalities of the Northeast Region of Brazil, relating it to the characteristics of this activity that can increase, alleviate or perpetuate poverty conditions, including elements that capture spatial dependence. For this purpose, data from the 2017 Agricultural Census were used. In addition, these data were disaggregated by typology of family farming, emphasizing the delimitation of poor and extremely poor rural producers categorized in the so-called Group B of the National Program for Strengthening Family Farming (PRONAF), in addition to the Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA). The results indicate that, despite the Northeast Region having the largest number of establishments and employed persons in the Brazilian Agricultural sector, there is a marked internal differentiation. Family farming is dominant, but it has the smallest amount of land and production value. Furthermore, in the family segment, there is a predominance of poor and extremely poor producers allocated in Group B of PRONAF, who have little access to technologies and sources of financing and a low degree of association. In addition, most of the establishments in Group B of PRONAF have their self-consumption as their main production purpose, with the income obtained from the activities carried out in the establishment being predominantly lower than the income from other sources. In addition to the income generated by the establishment?s production, income from retirement and pension resources and from government programs stands out. Furthermore, the ESDA made it possible to identify: possible spatial inequalities municipalities with low values of the analyzed parameters, with neighbors whose average of the parameters is also low and agglomerations potentially inducing economic development, through integration and local complementarity, provided by the concentration of productive activity."

Currently, most growers randomly install a limited number of sensors due to economic implications and data management issues. The microclimate within a protected cultivation system is continuously affected by the macroclimate (ambient), which further complicates decision-making around optimal sensor placement. The ambient weather?s effect on the indoor microclimate makes it challenging to predict or acquire the ideal condition of the systems through using sensors. This study proposed and implemented a machine learning (KMeans++) algorithm to select optimal sensor locations through clustering. Temperature and relative humidity data were collected from 56 different locations within the greenhouse for over a year covering and these covered four major seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter). The data was processed to remove outliers or noise interference using interquartile. The original temperature and relative humidity data were transformed to other air properties (dew point temperature, enthalpy, humid ratio, and specific volume) and used in simulations. The results obtained showed that the number of optimal sensor locations ranged between 3 and 5, and there were similar sensor locations among the air properties. An online machine learning web-based system was developed to systematically determine the optimal number of sensors and location"
38;"Risk evaluation of agricultural drought disaster using a grey cloud clustering model in Henan province, China";"Dang Luo a,b , Lili Ye b,* , Decai Sun b";"Frequent drought is a critical limiting factor for regional agriculture development. Accurately evaluating regional agricultural drought risk contributes to raising disaster risk management and reducing drought disaster losses. This paper proposes a grey cloud clustering model based on panel data to assess the agricultural drought disaster risk of Henan province. The new model includes two parts. One component is indicator and time weights determination which uses the grey incidence analysis methods, the maximum deviation and maximum entropy principle, respectively. The other part is the construction of grey cloud possibility function which calculates the drought disaster risk grade. Then, the proposed model is applied for assessing the agricultural drought disaster risk of Henan Province at the regional scale, and the time scale selected is from 2012 to 2016. The agricultural drought disaster presents different spatial distribution in drought hazard, exposure, damage sensitivity and drought resistance capacity. The comprehensive risk evaluation results indicate that the drought risk in the most northern and southern regions of Henan Province is lower, while the western, mid-western and eastern regions have a higher risk. Compared with the traditional assessment models for disaster risk, the proposed model can recognize the random, fuzzy and grey uncertainties of the agricultural drought disaster system. Thus, it is a beneficial tool for drought disaster risk assessment and can help to make some suggestions for drought disaster mitigation."

Yigezu b , Tilaye T. Deneke c , Girma T. Kassie d";"Although many studies have shown that sub-Saharan African countries could increase agricultural productivity and output through better technologies and improved crop varieties, the adoption of yieldenhancing technologies by smallholder farmers in the region still remains very low. In this paper, we use a cluster randomized controlled trial to examine whether improved extension services influence smallholder farmers? decisions to try a newly introduced improved wheat variety in Ethiopia. The experiment involved demonstration trials and field days, and improved capacity of Development Agents in facilitation and communication skills. The empirical results revealed that farmers? decisions to try the newly introduced wheat variety were highest in the villages where demonstration trials and field days, and improvements in the Development Agents? facilitation and communication capacity were introduced simultaneously. We also found a positive effect of improved extension services on yields, and the use of chemical fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides, but only the use of herbicides and pesticides were statistically significant. Our findings provide some insights into the significance of revisiting the curriculums of the Technical and Vocational Education and Training, and Farmers? Training Centers."
40;Agricultural Ontology Based Feature Optimization for Agricultural Text Clustering;"SU Ya-ru1, 2, WANG Ru-jing1, 2, CHEN Peng1, 2, WEI Yuan-yuan1, 2, LI Chuan-xi1, 2 and HU Yi-min";"Feature optimization is important to agricultural text mining. Usually, the vector space model is used to represent text documents. However, this basic approach still suffers from two drawbacks: the curse of dimension and the lack of semantic information. In this paper, a novel ontology-based feature optimization method for agricultural text was proposed. First, terms of vector space model were mapped into concepts of agricultural ontology, which concept frequency weights are computed statistically by term frequency weights second, weights of concept similarity were assigned to the concept features according to the structure of the agricultural ontology. By combining feature frequency weights and feature similarity weights based on the agricultural ontology, the dimensionality of feature space can be reduced drastically. Moreover, the semantic information can be incorporated into this method. The results showed that this method yields a significant improvement on agricultural text clustering by the feature optimization"
41;A novel segmentation algorithm for clustered flexional agricultural products based on image analysis;"Zihao Liu, Fang Cheng ? , Wei Zhang";"The problem for segmentation of clustered flexional agricultural products becomes complex when we perform the duties of counting and classification. A novel algorithm based on concavities and circle fitting is proposed to solve these difficulties. Initially, a circular mask method was applied into the contour images of clustered shrimp, to acquire a series of concavity points. Furthermore, the candidate segmentation lines can be acquired by connecting each two concavity points, and then the correctness for each candidate segmentation line was evaluated by designing four acceptance criterions. Additionally, one new point was acquired by combining adaptive two concavity points together to construct a training model to fit the circle equation, which can transform the erroneous straight segmentation lines into proper curve segmentation lines. Finally, the straight and curve segmentation lines were integrated in one clustered image to achieve the segmentation results. Experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm achieved a mean accuracy of 92.7% across the clustered shrimp dataset. Other two application examples of flexional agricultural products, such as clustered green pepper and shrimp meat, were also used to test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Segmentation results demonstrated it can successfully segment the images, which indicates the proposed algorithm has the potential to separate clustered flexional agricultural products."

According to dynamic characteristics, time variation, and the cooperativity of agricultural machinery cluster working, this paper proposes a service provider selection framework for the layout of dynamic maintenance network nodes. Furthermore, an integrated analytic network process (ANP) and balanced score card (BSC) service provider selection approach is provided to help construct the maintenance network. Concerning four determinants of BSC: service satisfaction, process capability, knowledge assets, and service cost, this method provides qualitative and quantitative indicators, four evaluative dimensions and a three-layer network evaluation system index. Moreover, this method is applied to maintenance services for agricultural machinery clusters working in crossregional operations in China. The results indicate that process capability is the most important determinant for a service network, and the proposed method contributes to the ability of decision-makers to comprehend the complex relationship among factors during the service provider selection process. Meanwhile, this method improves the reliability of service provider selection during the construction of a maintenance network"
43;Conventional German farmers? attitudes towards agricultural wood and their willingness to plant an alley cropping system as an ecological focus area: A cluster analysis;"Lara Beer* , Ludwig Theuvsen";"Agricultural wood (the cultivation of fast growing short rotation trees) is a way of complying with the Greening restrictions of the current European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The CAP permits Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) and Alley Cropping Systems (ACS) as Ecological Focus Area (EFA) methods of agricultural wood cultivation, although the latter method ? which is a kind of Agroforestry System - is not approved in Germany. In Germany, however, farmers are permitted to display the SRC-strips of an ACS separately as EFA. Cultivation data, however, shows that German farmers participate relatively little in agricultural wood growing. Their willingness to provide agricultural wood as EFA is also considerably low. Only a few European studies have yet dealt with farmers attitudes towards agricultural wood, and there are no studies that examine the willingness of farmers to plant ACS as EFA. To close this research gap, this article analyses German farmers attitudes towards agricultural wood and estimates their willingness to grow ACS as EFA. An evaluation of the 238 datasets shows that farmers? attitudes are generally negative however farmers cannot be seen as a homogeneous group regarding their attitudes and willingness to grow. Two of the four identified clusters comprise farmers who are willing to cultivate ACS as EFA, provided that the weighting factor is further increased. These potential growers are characterised by having larger farms with less leased land as well as more experience with agricultural wood. Conclusively, recommendations for action are given to improve the acceptance of ACS as EFA."
44;Identification of management zones in precision agriculture: An evaluation of alternative cluster analysis methods;"Alan Gavioli a,* , Eduardo Godoy de Souza b , Claudio Leones Bazzi a , Kelyn Schenatto c , Nelson Miguel Betzek";"The definition of management zones (MZs) in agricultural fields has been suggested as an economically viable approach to precision agriculture. The most used methods for this task are the cluster analysis algorithms Fuzzy C-means (FCM) and K-means. However, some studies have presented that these algorithms may not provide the best classes to define MZs. Considering that these studies presented comparisons of only a few clustering methods, the objective of our research was to evaluate 20 algorithms for defining MZs, including more than 10 methods that have not been investigated in the literature for this purpose. The following algorithms were evaluated: Average Linkage, Bagged Clustering, Centroid Linkage, Clara, Complete Linkage, Diana, Fanny, FCM, Fuzzy C-shells, Hard Competitive Learning, Hybrid Hierarchical Clustering, K-means, McQuittys Method, Median Linkage, Neural Gas, Partitioning Around Medoids, Single Linkage, Spherical K-means, Unsupervised Fuzzy Competitive Learning and Wards Method. The evaluation was conducted with data obtained between 2010 and 2015 from three commercial agricultural fields cultivated with soya bean and maize in Brazil. The results of the analysis of variance suggested a division of the three fields into two classes with significantly different yields and a division of one of the fields into three classes. These divisions were satisfactorily performed using 17 algorithms, but McQuittys Method and Fanny were considered to be the best choices because they produced the largest reductions in the variance of the yield in the three fields. In addition, they generated classes with high internal homogeneity and delimited MZs without spatial fragmentation"
45;Fuzzy clustering and fuzzy validity measures for knowledge discovery and decision making in agricultural engineering;"Vania C. Mota, Flavio A. Damasceno, Daniel F. Leite";"This paper concerns the application of fuzzy clustering methods and fuzzy validity measures for decision support in agricultural environment. Data clustering methods, namely, K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, Gustafson-Kessel, and Gath-Geva, are briefly reviewed and considered for analyses. The efficiency of the methods is determined by indices such as the Xie-Beni criterion, Partition Coefficient, and Partition and Dunn indices. In particular, fuzzy classifiers are developed to assist decision making regarding the control of variables such as bed moisture, temperature, and bed aeration in compost bedded pack barns. The idea is to identify interactive factors, promote cattle welfare, improve productivity indices, and increase property value. Data from 42 CBP barns in the state of Kentucky, US, were considered. Six classes related to the degree of efficiency of the composting process were identified. The GG method was the most accurate followed by the GK method. The main reason for the best results is the use of maximum-likelihood and Mahalanobis distance measures. A remark on the use of the Dunn validation index for different cluster geometries is given. Fuzzy models and linguistic information have shown to be useful to help decision making in cattle containment systems"
46;Visualizing regional clusters of Sardinias EU supported agriculture: A Spatial Fuzzy Partitioning Around Medoids;"Pierpaolo D?Ursoa , Germana Mancab,? , Nigel Watersc , Stefania Gironed";"The recurrent question about the effectiveness of agri-environmental measure (AEM) in Sardinia (Italy) is whether European Union (EU) funds allocate resources to where they are most needed. To answer this question, a spatial approach is suggested, namely an approach that considers geography as a factor in measuring the success of such policy. A geographical approach can be used to pinpoint ?hotspots? in order to determine an appropriate distribution of funds. To implement such an approach to the distribution of EU funding, a Spatial Fuzzy Partitioning Around Medoids (SFPAM) analysis is advocated. The contribution of this research is that it combines a temporal dimension within an explicitly spatial approach. It achieves this by using a dataset that includes both geographical and economic factors such as farm sizes, their management, the number of organic farms involved, the agriculture area invested by the AEM and the size of the workforce involved. Its strategy is the identification of medoids which are represented by a specific municipality. This allows the identification of aggregated neighborhoods for the visualization of AEM outcomes based on a fuzzy partitioning method. The results provide useful policy implications to determine where and when financial efforts should be renewed, where to negotiate sustainable development strategies, and how to expand spatially the benefits of financial funding to other agricultural measures, such as technological innovations in agriculture, reforestation programs, marketing strategies, climate change mitigation, and rural development."
47;A hybrid method combining SOM-based clustering and object-based analysis for identifying land in good agricultural condition;"Kadim Tasdemir ? , Pavel Milenov, Brooke Tapsall";"Remotely sensed imagery is currently used as an efficient tool for agricultural management and monitoring. In addition, the use of remotely sensed imagery in Europe has been extended towards determination of the areas potentially eligible for the farmer subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), through interactive or automatic land cover identification. For accurate quantification and fast identification of agricultural land cover areas from the imagery, a hybrid method, which combines automated clustering of self-organizing maps with object based image analysis, and called SOM + OBIA, is proposed. Performance analysis on three test zones (using multi-temporal Rapideye imagery) indicates that for the basic land cover categories (forest, water, vegetated areas, bare areas and sealed surfaces), unsupervised classification with the proposed SOM + OBIA method achieves an identification accuracy comparable to the accuracy of the traditional interactive object oriented analysis, with considerably less user interaction."
48;Energy productivity and GHG emission in the european agriculture: The club convergence approach;"Tomas Bale?zentis * , Mindaugas Butkus, Dalia Streimikien ? e";"The agricultural production plays an important role in food provision and income generation for the rural population. To mitigate the climate change and ensure food security, the agricultural sector has faced multiple initiatives, including the European Green Deal. Developing effective frameworks for measures under such initiatives requires identifying reasonable benchmarks. Accordingly, it is important to assess the patterns of input use and productivity in the agricultural sector. This paper focuses on the agricultural energy productivity in the European Union (EU) Member States during 2005?2019. Indeed, the EU allocates substantial support to improve resource efficiency and reduce climate pressures in the agriculture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to apply the club convergence approach for the energy productivity the EU agriculture. This particular approach allows identifying the homogenous groups of the EU countries and, subsequently, assess the dynamics of the agricultural energy productivity within these groups. The results indicate that the agricultural energy productivity still requires attention in the EU countries, as only partial convergence was observed during 2015?2019. The EU countries were grouped into five clusters with different levels of the agricultural energy productivity. The results imply that the differences among resulting clusters remained rather stable over time. Therefore, relevant policies addressing energy efficiency issues can be developed for these relatively homogeneous groups to ensure further cohesion. The results suggest that countries with high energy productivity may show high levels of greenhouse gas intensity (and low levels of, e.g., labour productivity). Therefore, energy conservation and introduction of clean energy is a complex task that can be guided by the proposed framework and adjustment in the Common Agricultural Policy measures."
49;"Spatial differences of specialty agriculture development in the mountainous areas of China -- one village, one product as an example";"Zhenyu Huang a,b , Minghong Tan";"With the rapid development of urbanization, the rate of abandonment of arable land in China?s mountainous areas has accelerated. Solving the phenomenon of abandonment of arable land has become an important issue in managing the use of China?s arable land, the key to which lies in the development of specialty agriculture using the unique natural environment of mountainous areas. This paper scrutinizes both the horizontal and vertical distribution of specialty agriculture in these areas, drawing upon the ?One Village, One Product? dataset provided by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The findings reveal that the horizontal distribution pattern of specialty agriculture exhibits the formation of eight primary clusters. It is intriguing to observe that a majority of these clusters are situated at the intersection of two or three provincial administrative units, with the largest cluster occurring at the border of Chengdu and Chongqing. In terms of the vertical distribution pattern, the specialty agriculture in China?s mountainous areas are mainly distributed at low altitudes, i.e., below 500 m, and at gentle slopes of 4??8?, and with increases in altitude or slope, the overall amount of specialty agriculture declines rapidly."

Currently, AI methods are used mostly in machine vision applications. Practical applications that use methods other than image data are scarce. However, agricultural machines produce an ever-increasing amount of process data during agricultural operations. There is huge potential to gain useful information from this data. This paper presents a case example of treatment-zone determination based on agricultural process data using clustering methods. This paper also describes how AI is incorporated into the Cropinfra research data collection platform. Based on the experiences gained from Cropinfra-related research projects and a review of research papers, we predict the future directions of Artificial Intelligence in agriculture."

Henao c , Carlos A. Villarreal-Jaimes d , Olga M. Medina-P?erez e,g , Laura A. Rodriguez-Villamizarf , Alvaro J. Idrovo f , Luz H. Sanchez-Rodr?uez ? e,";"Anthropogenic and natural sources contribute to chemical mixtures in air, water, and soil, posing potential risks to the environment and human health. To understand the interplay between element profiles in the human body, geographical location, and associated economic activities, we carried out an observational analytic crosssectional study. The study recruited 199 participants from three municipalities, two of which had gold-mining as their primary economic activity, while the other was dedicated to agricultural and other local activities not related to mining. The concentrations of a total of 30 elements in human hair samples and 21 elements in environmental soil samples were measured using various spectrometry techniques. Unsupervised clustering analysis using Self-Organizing Maps was applied to human hair samples to analyze element concentrations. Distinct clusters of individuals were identified based on their hair element profiles, which were mapped to geographical location and economic activities. While higher levels of heavy metals (Ag, As, Hg, and Pb) were observed in individuals engaged in mining activities in certain clusters, individuals in agricultural areas show higher concentrations of elements found in pesticides (Ba and Sr). However, the elemental composition of hair is influenced not only by the anthropogenic activities but also by the inherent geological context where people live. Our findings highlight the significance of accounting for environmental factors when evaluating human health risks, as the intricate mixture of elements can yield valuable insights for targeted health interventions."

In this new digital age, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, has allowed for acceleration and improvement in the processing of collected data. To highlight the evolution and advances observed in deep learning in agriculture, we conducted a bibliometric study on more than 400 recent research studies. The analyses carried out on recent research works suggest that deep learning is widely involved in the digitization of agriculture areas with high accuracy exceeding the standard image processing techniques. Most of the works focus on crop classification problems, weed, and pest identification. Their methods are mainly based on convolutional neural network architecture.

56;A review on the combination of deep learning techniques with proximal hyperspectral images in agriculture;Jayme Garcia Arnal Barbedo;"Hyperspectral images can capture the spectral characteristics of surfaces and objects, providing a 2-D spacial component to the spectral profiles found in a given scene. There are several techniques that can be used to extract information from hyperspectral images, with deep learning becoming the preferred choice in the last decade due to its ability to implicitly extract features from images. The combination of hyperspectral images with deep learning has been extensively explored in the context of remote sensing (data collected by drones and satellites), which has generated an extensive literature that has been thoroughly analyzed in a series of reviews and surveys. The application of deep learning to proximal hyperspectral images is more recent, but there are already many articles dedicated to this objective, especially in the areas of agriculture and food science. Although significant progress has been made in just a few years, there are still many aspects that are not well understood and many problems that have not yet been overcome. This review aims at characterizing the current state of the art of deep learning applied to hyperspectral images captured at close range, focusing on the main challenges and research gaps that still need to be properly addressed. Some possible solutions and potential directions for future research are suggested, as an effort to bring the techniques developed in the academy closer to meeting the requirements found in practice. Only applications related to vegetable production and products were considered in this review, because applications related to animal farming and products of animal origin have their own particularities and the literature on the subject is not as extensive."

58;Object localization methodology in occluded agricultural environments through deep learning and active sensing;"Teng Sun * , Wen Zhang , Zhonghua Miao * , Zhe Zhang , Nan Li";"The predominance of branch and leaf shade in agricultural environments presents a barrier for accurate target recognition. Particularly for picking robots, precise localization of the picking object is essential. For this purpose, this paper proposes detection and localization methods based on deep learning and active sensing for harvesting robots in real-world environments with occlusion and varying lighting conditions. Using a deep learning network, the detection method firstly extracts the peduncle and fruit regions the fruit region is then used to calculate the occlusion rate and the offset distance of the peduncle relative to the fruit. With such information, the robot arm adjusts the camera?s field of view to perform multiple recognitions until the confidence is satisfied. Furthermore, to solve the picking problem caused by the peduncle?s random tilting, this paper proposes a method to calculate the peduncle?s tilt angle for controlling the end-effector to make the corresponding angle rotation. The robot arm and its end-effector are directed to complete the harvesting with the picking point location and tilt angle. In this study, data collection, detection and picking tests were implemented in the field, the results indicated that the method obtained an average successful picking rate of 90% after 300 trials, the error between the estimated occlusion ratio and the genuine value is 16% in average, and the active sensing method has improved the confidence score in occluded situations by over 50%. The proposed active methods have a 33% increase in precision and a 43% increase in efficiency compared to constant methods."

Kathole a,* , Jayashree Katti b , Savita Lonare a , Gulbakshee Dharmale";"The most significant challenges impacting agricultural production and preventing the sustainable expansion of the agricultural sector are insect pests and crop diseases. It is inefficient to put surveillance cameras in areas densely populated by the pests you are trying to catch, and it is typically not enough to check in on the photos generated by your Internet of Things monitoring devices from a single location. Although the Internet of Things (IoT) is a specialised technology and analytics system, it has found many applications, including in agricultural contexts. To aid in identifying and naming the insects seen in the pictures, this study seeks to establish a model for pest identification and categorisation. In the beginning, data is gathered by Internet of Things devices using the IoT platform. The collected images are then subjected to an object detection analysis using Yolov3.

64;A deep learning approach for automatic identification of ancient agricultural water harvesting systems;"Arti Tiwari, Micha Silver, Arnon Karnieli *";"Despite the harsh climatic conditions in the Central Negev Desert, Israel, thousands of dry stonewalls were built across ephemeral streams between the fourth and seventh centuries CE to sustain productive agricultural activity. Since 640 CE, many of these ancient terraces have remained untouched but buried by sediments, covered by natural vegetation, and partially destroyed. The main goal of the current research is to develop a procedure for the automatic recognition of ancient water harvesting systems by incorporating two remote sensing datasets (a high-resolution color orthophoto and LiDAR-derived topographic variables) and two advanced processing methods (an object-based image analysis (OBIA) and a deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) model). A confusion matrix of object-based classification revealed an overall accuracy of 86% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.79. The DCNN model achieved a Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) value for testing datasets of 53. The individual IoU values of terraces and sidewalls were 33.2 and 30.1, respectively. The current study demonstrates how incorporating OBIA, aerial photographs, and LiDAR in the context of DCNN improves the identification and mapping of archaeological structures."
65;Using unmanned aerial systems and deep learning for agriculture mapping in Dubai;"Lala El Hoummaidi a,b,* , Abdelkader Larabi a , Khan Alam";"As part of the sustainable future vision, sustainable agriculture has become an essential pillar of the food security strategies formulated by the Dubai Government. Therefore, the Dubai Emirate began relying on new technology to increase productivity and efficiency. Agriculture applications also depend on accurate land monitoring for timely food security control and support actions. However, traditional monitoring requires field surveys to be performed by experts, which is costly, slow, and rare. Agriculture monitoring systems must be furnished with sustainable land use monitoring solutions, starting with remote sensing using drone surveys for affordable, efficient, and timesensitive agriculture mapping. Hence, the Dubai Municipality is currently using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to map the farming areas all over the Emirate, support locating lands conducive to cultivation, and create an accurate agriculture database contributing to the decision-making process in determining areas suitable for crop growth. This study used a novel object detection method coupled with geospatial analysis as an integrated workflow to detect individual crops. The UAV flights were executed using a Trimble UX5 (HP) over twelve communities across the Dubai Emirate for six months. Detection methods were applied to high-resolution drone images, consisting of RGB and near-infrared (NIR) bands. Advanced geoprocessing tools were also used to analyze, evaluate, and enhance the results. The performance of detection of the selected deep learning models are discussed (vegetation cover accuracy ? 85.4%, F1-scores for date palms and ghaf trees ? 96.03% and 94.54% respectively, with respect to visual interpretation ground truth) moreover, sample images from the datasets are used for demonstrations.

Here, we leveraged advances in Machine Learning and availability of very high resolution remote sensing imagery to help resolve this long-standing issue. To this end, we developed a deep learning model to classify irrigation systems at a regional scale using remote sensing imagery. After testing different model architectures, hyper parameters, class weights and image sizes, we selected a U-Net architecture with a Resnet-34 backbone for this purpose. We applied transfer learning to increase training efficiency and model performance. We considered four irrigation systems as well as urban and background areas as land use/ cover classes, and applied the model to 8,600 very high resolution (1 m) images, labeled with ground-truth observations of irrigation types, in a case study in Idaho, USA.

69;Towards an Efficient Recommender Systems in Smart Agriculture: A deep reinforcement learning approach;"Mohamed Bouni 1 a, *, Badr Hssina 1 b, Khadija Douzi 1 c , Samira Douzi";"A profitable agriculture system is the fundamental foundation of a rising economy. Precise prediction of crop yield focuses primarily on agriculture research that has a significant effect on making decisions such as import-export, pricing, and distribution of specific crops. There is a severe need to utilize advanced technologies in order to improve yield quality and creation, anticipate crop yields, and study crop diseases/infections. The most prevalent issue among farmers is that they do not select the appropriate crop based on their soil needs. As a result, they see a significant decrease in production. In this paper, we presented a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based crop classification system for precision agriculture selection to solve the farmers dilemma.

72;Iterative Deep Learning (IDL) for agricultural landscape classification using fine spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery;"Huapeng Li a,* , Ce Zhang b,* , Shuqing Zhang a , Xiaohui Ding c , Peter M. Atkinson";"The agricultural landscape can be interpreted at different semantic levels, such as fine low-level crop (LLC) classes (e.g., Wheat, Almond, and Alfalfa) and broad high-level crop (HLC) classes (e.g., Winter crops, Tree crops, and Forage). The LLC and HLC are hierarchically correlated with each other, but such intrinsically hierarchical relationships have been overlooked in previous crop classification studies in remote sensing. In this research, a novel Iterative Deep Learning (IDL) framework was proposed for the classification of complex agricultural landscapes using remotely sensed imagery. The IDL adopts an object-based convolutional neural network (OCNN) as the basic classifier for both the LLC and HLC classifications, which has the advantage of maintaining precise crop parcel boundaries. In IDL, the HLC classification implemented by the OCNN is conditional upon the LLC classification probabilities, whereas the HLC probabilities combined with the original imagery are, in turn, re-used as inputs to the OCNN to enhance the LLC classification. Such an iterative updating procedure forms a Markov process, where both the LLC and HLC classifications are refined and evolve collaboratively. The effectiveness of the IDL was tested on two heterogeneous agricultural fields using fine spatial resolution (FSR) SAR and optical imagery. The experimental results demonstrate that the iterative process of IDL helps to resolve contradictions within the class hierarchies. The new proposed IDL consistently increased the accuracies of both the LLC and HLC classifications with iteration, and achieved the highest accuracies for each at four iterations. The average overall accuracies were 88.4% for LLC and 91.2% for HLC, for both study sites, far greater than the accuracies of the state-of-the-art benchmarks, including the pixel-wise CNN (81.7% and 85.9%), object-based image analysis (OBIA) (84.0% and 85.8%), and OCNN (84.0% and 88.4%). To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is the first to identify and use the relationship between the class levels in an ontological hierarchy in a remote sensing classification process. It is applied here to increase progressively the accuracy of classification at two levels for a complex agricultural landscape. As such IDL represents an entirely new paradigm for remote sensing image classification. Moreover, the promising results demonstrate the great potential of the proposed IDL with wide application prospect."
73;Data augmentation for deep learning based semantic segmentation and crop-weed classification in agricultural robotics;"Daobilige Su a , He Kong b,* , Yongliang Qiao b , Salah Sukkarieh";"Deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) have become popular for addressing crops and weeds classification problems in agricultural robotics. However, to have satisfactory performance and avoid overfitting, training deep neural nets typically requires thousands of labeled images. This leads to tedious pixelwise labeling for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we hinge on the recent development in data augmentation and utilize the concept further for semantic segmentation and classification of crops and weeds. To be specific, we propose a novel data augmentation framework, based on the random image cropping and patching (RICAP) method, which is originally designed to augment data for generic image classification. The proposed framework introduces novel enhancements to the original RICAP so that it can be effectively used for data augmentation of semantic segmentation tasks. We evaluate the proposed methodology on two datasets from different farms. Comprehensive experimental evaluations and ablation studies show that the proposed framework can effectively improve segmentation accuracies, and the enhancements made over the original RICAP actually contribute to the performance gain. On average, the proposed method increases the mean accuracy and mean intersection over union (IOU) of the deep neural net with the conventional data augmentation (random flipping, rotation and colour jitter) from 91.01 to 94.02 and from 63.59 to 70.77 respectively for Narrabri dataset, and from 97.99 to 98.51 and from 74.26 to 77.09 respectively for Bonn dataset.

Nearinfrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a modern technology suitable for rapid detection of agricultural targets. For monitoring the agricultural water resource, the NIR modeling methods are required to be smart and artificially controlled to solve the issues when we confront a considerable number of data or a dynamic situation. In this study, an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was designed for a deep calibration on the NIR data. The architecture is shallow, simply constructed with one convolution layer and one pooling layer. The decision tree algorithm was employed in the pooling layer for extracting the informative features in a data driven manner. The CNN architecture was trained by combined tuning of multiple parameters in different layers. The convolution filters, the decision tree branches and the hidden neurons in the fully connected layer were automatically adaptive with fidelity to the measured data. A CNN calibration model for NIR quantitatively determination of water pollution level was then established and optimized in deep learning mode, and eventually improved the NIR prediction accuracy. Prospectively, the designed shallow CNN architecture is feasible to be used for establishing intelligent spectroscopic models for evaluating the level of water pollution, and is expected to provide smart technical support in dealing with the issues of water recycling and conservation for agricultural cultivation."

77;Field detection of tiny pests from sticky trap images using deep learning in agricultural greenhouse;"Wenyong Li a,b , Dujin Wang a,b , Ming Li a,b , Yulin Gao c , Jianwei Wu a,d,* , Xinting Yang";"Agricultural pest catches on sticky traps can be used for the early detection and identification of hotspots, as well as for estimating relative abundances of adult pests, occurring in greenhouses. This study aimed to construct a detection model for whitefly and thrips from sticky trap images acquired in greenhouse conditions. An end-toend model, based on the Faster regional-convolutional neural network (R-CNN), termed ?TPest-RCNN?, was developed to improve the tiny pest detection accuracy. This architecture was trained using a transfer learning strategy on the Common Objects in Context dataset before training on the tiny pest training set to create the TPest-RCNN model. The new model achieved mean F1 score and average precision of 0.944 and 0.952, respectively, on a validation set. The TPest-RCNN model outperformed the Faster R-CNN architecture and other approaches using handcrafted features (color, shape and/or texture) in detecting multiple species from yellow sticky trap images. The test results also showed the model was robust to detect tiny pests on images of different pest densities and light reflections. Using a linear regression between the manual counts and an automatic detection results using the proposed method on images of 41 days, the determination coefficients reached 99.6% and 97.4% for whitefly and thrips, respectively. These results demonstrated that the proposed method could facilitate rapid gathering of information pertaining to numbers of the abundance of tiny pests in greenhouse agriculture and provide a technical reference for pest monitoring and population estimation"
78;A fast and easy method for predicting agricultural waste compost maturity by image-based deep learning;"Wei Xuea , Xuejiao Hua , Zhong Weib , Xinlan Meib , Xingjian Chenb , Yangchun Xub";"Large amounts of agricultural wastes are generated in agricultural production, and composting this waste is one of the best ways to recycle resources. Compost maturity is an important criterion for measuring the quality of compost-products. Biochemical tests are conventional methods to evaluate compost maturity, but they are time consuming and difficult to perform. Therefore, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were introduced to realize fast evaluation of compost maturity by analyzing images of different composting stages. Images of 3 different composting materials were collected to build 4 data sets, which included nearly 30,000 images, and a series of experiments were performed on them. The accuracy of proposed method was 99.7%, 99.4%, 99.7% and 99.5% on the 4 test sets, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-based prediction model produces state of the art results and can be used to predict compost maturity during the composting process."
79;Deep learning applications for oil palm tree detection and counting;"Kuryati Kipli * , Salleh Osman, Annie Joseph, Hushairi Zen, Dayang Nur Salmi Dharmiza Awang Salleh, Asrani Lit, Kho Lee Chin";"Oil palms are one of the essential crops in agricultural productivity for developing countries such as Malaysia and other tropical areas. For predicting the yield and production of palm oil, the counting process is often carried out. Manually counting oil palm trees is one of the solutions but it requires a massive labour force, and the result is often inaccurate. To overcome this problem, automated techniques for oil palm detection have been developed. However, the performance of existing automated techniques for oil palm detection deteriorates when the planting layout of the oil palm tree is not well organized. Deep learning applications for oil palm tree detection and counting offer a powerful solution to the challenges of precision agriculture, enabling plantations to increase productivity and sustainability while reducing costs and manual labour. Deep structured learning, more generally deep learning is one of the widely used computer vision technology, especially in agricultural engineering. Deep learning method is an essential tool when it comes to monitoring the plantation. Different deep learning networks are utilized for classification tasks towards oil palm trees. In order to promote the use of deep learning in the oil palm industry, this paper main contribution is to provide an understanding of the utilisation of deep learning and its application in oil palm tree counting. The gaps and opportunities for research in oil palm plantations based on deep learning techniques will also be discussed."
80;Evaluating established deep learning methods in constructing integrated remote sensing drought index: A case study in China;"Zhenheng Xu, Hao Sun * , Tian Zhang, Huanyu Xu, Dan Wu, JinHua Gao";"Agricultural drought seriously threatens the food and ecological security of most of the world?s developing countries. Data-driven integrated agricultural drought index with remote sensing provides an effective tool to monitor, evaluate, and predict the agricultural drought. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive analytical work on taking the most effective machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to construct such integrated drought index. In other words, it is still unclear whether the recent DL methods can improve integrated drought monitoring as compared with the currently widely used ML methods. Therefore, we critically evaluated the performances of four representative DL methods (represents the four currently popular DL network types) i.e., Entity Embedding Deep Neural Network (EEDNN), One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Self-Attention Mechanism (SAM) and three widely used tree-based ML methods i.e., Cubist, Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), through constructing a QuickDRI like integrated drought index (abbreviated as QuickDRI-China). About 30 years of meteorological data, 14 years of remote sensing data, and various biophysical variables in China such as land use/land cover, available water capacity, irrigated agriculture, elevation, and ecoregion were employed in this study. Results showed that the EEDNN performed best, followed by the RF and LGBM, and then the other methods including the currently wide used Cubist, according to the station accuracy evaluations, spatial description evaluations, and responses to specific drought event. The tree-based ML methods such as RF and LGBM are still competitive in constructing the integrated agricultural drought index at the current stage. However, the higher accuracy, the smoother spatial description, and the more responsive ability of the EEDNN demonstrate great potential of DL methods. The future integrated agricultural drought monitoring with remote sensing should develop a specialized DL network for heterogeneous agricultural drought features."

86;Towards improving prediction accuracy and user-level explainability using deep learning and knowledge graphs: A study on cassava disease;"Tek Raj Chhetri a,b,* , Armin Hohenegger a , Anna Fensel c,d , Mariam Aramide Kasali e , Asiru Afeez Adekunle";"Food security is currently a major concern due to the growing global population, the exponential increase in food demand, the deterioration of soil quality, the occurrence of numerous diseases, and the effects of climate change on crop yield. Sustainable agriculture is necessary to solve this food security challenge. Disruptive technologies, such as of artificial intelligence, especially, deep learning techniques can contribute to agricultural sustainability. For example, applying deep learning techniques for early disease classification allows us to take timely action, thereby helping to increase the yield without inflicting unnecessary environmental damage, such as excessive use of fertilisers or pesticides. Several studies have been conducted on agricultural sustainability using deep learning techniques and also semantic web technologies such as ontologies and knowledge graphs. However, the three major challenges remain: (i) the lack of explainability of deep learning-based systems (e.g. disease information), especially to non-experts like farmers (ii) a lack of contextual information (e.g. soil or plant information) and domain-expert knowledge in deep learning-based systems and (iii) the lack of pattern learning ability of systems based on the semantic web, despite their ability to incorporate domain knowledge. Therefore, this paper presents the work on disease classification, addressing the challenges as mentioned earlier by combining deep learning and semantic web technologies, namely ontologies and knowledge graphs. The findings are: (i) 0.905 (90.5%) prediction accuracy on large noisy dataset (ii) ability to generate user-level explanations about disease and incorporate contextual and domain knowledge (iii) the average prediction latency of 3.8514 s on 5268 samples (iv) 95% of users finding the explanation of the proposed method useful and (v) 85% of users being able to understand generated explanations easily?show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of performance and explainability and is also suitable for real-world scenarios."

88;Deep learning-based automatic recognition network of agricultural machinery images;"Ziqiang Zhanga,b,1 , Hui Liua,? , Zhijun Mengb , Jingping Chenb";"Due to the massive amount of data generated by the mobile Internet and the development of large-scale computing devices and technologies, the deep learning algorithm has experienced a breakthrough in terms of image recognition technology. Traditional image recognition requires the complex extraction of image features, whereas deep learning technology can automatically learn image features through multi-layer nonlinear transformation, which is especially proficient at extracting complex global features. An image annotation dataset containing the images of seven types of machines and six types of abnormal images was constructed in this study from the large number of machine images in the agricultural machinery operation supervisory service system. To improve the Inception_v3 network, a network called AMTNet was designed and trained for automatic recognition of agricultural machinery images. Under the same experimental conditions, AMTNet achieved recognition accuracies of 97.83% and 100% on validation sets Top_1 and Top_5, respectively, demonstrating better performance than the classic networks ResNet_50 and Inception_v3. To further test the performance of AMTNet, 200 images of each of the 13 types of machine images were selected as test sets. The average area under the curve and F1-score of the network for image recognition of various machines reached 92% and 96%, respectively.

89;Internet of things enabled deep learning methods using unmanned aerial vehicles enabled integrated farm management;Shailendra Mishra;"Smart livestock farming strives to make farming more lucrative, efficient, and ecologically beneficial by using digital technologies. Precision livestock fencing, in which each animal is followed and studied independently, is the most promising kind of smart livestock farming. The Internet of Things (IoT) allows farmers to save money and effort by keeping tabs on crops, mapping out their land, and giving them data to develop sensible management strategies for their farms. Surveillance, disaster management, firefighting, border patrol, and courier services employ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that are originally created for the military. The segment focuses on UAVs in livestock and agricultural production. This is achieved via employing robots, drones, remote sensors, and computer imagery in unison with ever-improving in-Depth Learning for farming. Deep learning (DL) algorithms find many uses in the agricultural sector, from identifying plant diseases to estimating yields to detecting weeds to forecasting the weather and determining how much water is in the soil. The challenging characteristics of smart livestock farming are climate change, biodiversity loss, and continuous monitoring. Hence, in this research, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles enabled Integrated Farm Management (UAV-IFM) has been designed to improve smart livestock farming. Safe and reliable tracking of livestock from farm to fork is made possible by this sensor, which has far-reaching implications for detecting and containing disease outbreaks and preventing the resulting financial losses and food-related health pandemics. UAV-IFM aims to improve the assessment process so that smart livestock farming may be more widely adopted and offers growth-supportive help to farmers. Conclusions gathered from this study?s examination of the UAV-IFM reveal that these instruments correctly forecast and verify smart livestock farming management within the framework of the assessment procedure. The experimental analysis of UAV-IFM outperforms smart livestock farming in terms of efficiency ratio, performance, accuracy, and prediction."

91;Monitoring of grain crops nitrogen status from uav multispectral images coupled with deep learning approaches;"I. Blekanov a,b,* , A. Molin b , D. Zhang c , E. Mitrofanov b,d , O. Mitrofanova b,d , Yin Li";"Effective nitrogen nutrition is vital for better crop yield. In order to get the maximum yield from a field, nutrition must be spread evenly among all crops. Therefore, this paper proposes a combination of deep learning image segmentation methods to monitor nutrition across an agricultural field and detect areas with shortages of nutrients. In particular, the authors consider the applicability of five state-of-the-art neural network architectures based on U-Net to solve the nitrogen level rate segmentation problem for crops on an orthophotomap. Training, effectiveness assessment, and applicability of these neural network models are carried out by the authors on their own multi-datasets, collected by using UAS (Geoscan 401) at the Agrophysical Research Institute (ARI) experimental biopolygon for 2020?2021. The survey was performed using a MicaSense RedEdge-MX multispectral camera (5 channels in total). The total size of the collected dataset is more than 20 thousand images of two different agricultural fields (with a total area of about 62 ha). On each field, there are six test areas with known nitrogen nutrition levels (founded by agronomists). Images of these test areas are used for data augmentation and training of the above-mentioned neural network models (U-Net, Attention U-Net, R2-UNet, Attention R2-Unet, and U-Net3+). Also, in this research, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of the choice of different bands of field images on the accuracy of the considered segmentation methods. The experiment showed that among all models, Attention R2U-Net (t2) proved to be more robust and reliable for different kinds of crops (accuracy 97.59?99.96%). The authors also evaluated the impact of using different combinations of image bands (such as RGB, RedEdge, NearIR, and NDVI) on the segmentation accuracy of the neural network model. The combination of RGB, NearIR, and NDVI channels allowed for the high values of all 8 metrics used in this research (0.41?1.77% more than the standard combination of RGB bands). The use of the RedEdge band has a significant negative impact on the quality of segmentation of the nitrogen level in the agricultural field. The proposed method based on Attention R2U-Net (t2) and a combination of RGB, NearIR, and NDVI bands is stable for different types of agricultural landscapes and can help to improve crop nutrition and yield."

Al-antari";"Agricultural productivity plays a vital role in global economic development and growth. When crops are affected by diseases, it adversely impacts a nation?s economic resources and agricultural output. Early detection of crop diseases can minimize losses for farmers and enhance production. In this study, we propose a new hybrid deep learning model, PLDPNet, designed to automatically predict potato leaf diseases. The PLDPNet framework encompasses image collection, pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and fusion, and classification. We employ an ensemble approach by combining deep features from two well-established models (VGG19 and Inception-V3) to generate more powerful features. The hybrid approach leverages the concept of vision transformers for final prediction. To train and evaluate PLDPNet, we utilize the public potato leaf dataset: early blight, late blight, and healthy leaves. Utilizing the strength of segmentation and fusion feature, the proposed approach achieves an overall accuracy of 98.66%, and F1-score of 96.33%. A comprehensive validation study is conducted using Apple (4 classes) and tomato (10 classes) datasets achieving impressive accuracies of 96.42% and 94.25%, respectively. These experimental findings confirm that the proposed hybrid framework provides more effective and accurate detection and prediction of potato crop diseases, making it a promising candidate for practical applications."
93;Cost-efficient coupled learning methods for recovering near-infrared information from RGB signals: Application in precision agriculture;"Alexandros Gkillas * , Dimitrios Kosmopoulos, Kostas Berberidis";"Multispectral imaging and the derived spectral analysis offer useful tools for revealing beneficial information for a variety of applications, e.g., precision agriculture, medical imaging and autonomous driving. Contrary to mainstream RGB cameras that can capture information derived only from three bands within the visible spectrum, the multispectral cameras can offer better spectral resolution by utilizing the underlying information in the visible and the near-infrared spectrum. However, the cost of the multispectral cameras is very high and their mobility is limited due to their weight and their need for special hardware equipment. Considering the aforementioned limitations, we propose two low-cost and efficient methods to infer detailed spectral information outside the visible spectrum range by employing only an RGB camera. The proposed methods require significantly less training data, containing approximately 99.8% less parameters compared to the competing deep learning approaches and can be deployed on various edge devices with computational and power constraints, e.g., mobile phones or unmanned drones for addressing problems in precision agriculture under real-field settings. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed models to reconstruct images outside the visible spectrum. Additionally, the reconstructed images can be utilized to estimate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which can reveal valuable information concerning the health of the monitored plants without the need of a multispectral camera."

A considerable number of studies have investigated the potential of deep learning techniques for precision agriculture in the last decade. However, despite the range of applications, several gaps within plant disease research are yet to be addressed to support disease management on farms. Thus, there is a need to establish a knowledge base of existing applications and identify the challenges and opportunities to help advance the development of tools that address farmers? needs. This study presents a comprehensive overview of 70 studies on deep learning applications and the trends associated with their use for disease diagnosis and management in agriculture.

95;Self-supervised contrastive learning on agricultural images;"Ronja Gdenring * , Lazaros Nalpantidis";"Agriculture emerges as a prominent application domain for advanced computer vision algorithms. As much as deep learning approaches can help solve problems such as plant detection, they rely on the availability of large amounts of annotated images for training. However, relevant agricultural datasets are scarce and at the same time, generic well-established image datasets such as ImageNet do not necessarily capture the characteristics of agricultural environments. This observation has motivated us to explore the applicability of self-supervised contrastive learning on agricultural images. Our approach considers numerous non-annotated agricultural images, which are easy to obtain, and uses them to pre-train deep neural networks. We then require only a limited number of annotated images to fine-tune those networks in a supervised training manner for relevant downstream tasks, such as plant classification or segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, contrastive selfsupervised learning has not been explored before in the area of agricultural images. Our results reveal that it outperforms conventional deep learning approaches in classification downstream tasks, especially for small amounts of available annotated training images where up to 14% increase of average top-1 classification accuracy has been observed. Furthermore, the computational cost for generating data-specific pre-trained weights is fairly low, allowing one to generate easily new pre-trained weights for any custom model architecture or task."
96;Multi-sensor spectral fusion to model grape composition using deep learning;"Salvador Guti?rez a,* , Juan Fern?dez-Novales b,c , Teresa Garde-Cerd? c , Sandra Mar?-San Rom? c , Javier Tardaguila b,c , Mar? P. Diago";"Spectral instruments can be useful for the rapid assessment of chemical compounds in different targets, and their use have been already reported for the modeling of grape composition comparing two spectral ranges. Still, with the increased easiness of acquiring data with several sensors, it would be valuable to explore spectral fusion techniques for the modeling with deep learning, seeking to obtain improved performance. Therefore, the objective of this work was to develop multi-sensor spectral fusion approaches for the deep learning modeling of grape composition. From 128 grape samples, two spectra per sample were acquired from two different ranges using two sensors (visible and shortwave near infrared, 570?1000 nm and wider NIR 1100?2100 nm). From each sample, 15 grape nitrogen compounds were analyzed by wet chemistry. Three different data fusion approaches are defined using neural networks and deep learning, testing several ways of structuring and merging the input spectra. Statistical analyses supported that (i) the proposed deep learning fusion architectures performed better than single spectral range models, and (ii) neural networks have better modeling capabilities than partial least squares in spectral fusion. The results demonstrate the potential of deep learning for spectral data fusion in grape nitrogen composition regression, and potentially other traits in food and agriculture spectroscopy."
97;A systematic analysis of machine learning and deep learning based approaches for identifying and diagnosing plant diseases;"Imtiaz Ahmed* , Pramod Kumar Yadav";"In agriculture, one of the most challenging tasks is the early detection of plant diseases. It is essential to identify diseases early in order to boost agricultural productivity. This problem has been solved with machine learning and deep learning techniques using an automated method for detecting plant diseases on large crop farms which is beneficial because it reduces monitoring time. In this paper, we used the dataset Plant Village with 17 basic diseases, with a display of four bacterial diseases, two viral illnesses, two mould illnesses, and one mite-related disease. A total of 12 crop species are also shown with images of unaffected leaves. The machine learning approaches viz support vector machines (SVMs), gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used for the development of prediction models.

Then, the processed feature subset is input to the deep convolution network. In fully connected layers, we used the L2 regularization method to prevent the overfitting problem. The phosphorylation sites are predicted by the sigmoid classifier. Finally, in the experimental part, in order to truly reflect the predictive power of the model, we divided the dataset into training set, validation set and independent test set. The prediction accuracy of the independent test set is 83.20%. The test result shows that the proposed algorithm has better prediction performance than the existing phosphorylation prediction algorithms the proposed algorithm has better prediction performance than the existing phosphorylation prediction algorithms."
99;Integrated digital image processing techniques and deep learning approaches for wheat stripe rust disease detection and grading;"Rafia Mumtaz a,* , Muhammad Hassan Maqsood a , Ihsan ul Haq a , Uferah Shafi a , Zahid Mahmood b , Mustafa Mumtaz";"This study proposes integrated image processing and deep learning approaches for wheat rust disease detection and grading. Wheat stripe rust is one of the diseases affecting the crop in nearly all wheat-growing countries, where humidity and high temperatures characterize the growing season. The early and prompt detection of this disease is essential for establishing timely remedial measures to contain its spread. We present several imageprocessing and deep-learning approaches for detecting wheat stripe rust. The image processing techniques used in this research include single-band and dual-band processing, computing the Visual Atmospheric Resistance Index (VARI), image segmentation, and image cropping. These techniques are evaluated with different deep learning approaches like transfer learning and other Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures. The results obtained on the dataset show that processing the images to eliminate the background as much as possible before training a suitable deep learning model with a low number of epochs optimally classifies the wheat stripe rust into the target classes (i.e., healthy, resistant, and susceptible) with an overall accuracy of 84.1% on the holdout test set. Besides the comparative analysis of various image processing approaches with different deep learning models, this study suggests multiple future research directions."
100;Agricultural drought conditions over mainland Southeast Asia: Spatiotemporal characteristics revealed from MODIS-based vegetation;"Tuyen V. Ha a,b,c,* , Soner Uereyen a , Claudia Kuenzer";"Drought is a reoccurring slow-onset hazard event and has a tremendous impact on agricultural production and ecosystem health. Mainland Southeast Asia is a major rainfed crop-producing area of the world, and this region is increasingly vulnerable to drought hazards. However, the monitoring and characterization of agricultural and vegetative droughts in this region remains understudied. This paper presented the first comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of agricultural and vegetative droughts across the region using the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) based on the reconstructed MODIS-based vegetation time-series data between 2000 and 2021. This study also developed an approach for identifying severe drought years using annual extreme pixels. Results showed that vegetation-based drought characteristics and trends varied in space and time across the region. Central Myanmar suffered from the most frequent droughts (nearly 60%), but prolonged events were less common. By contrast, the Lower Mekong area suffered from frequent and prolonged drought conditions. Most of the recent severe droughts were observed in Cambodia, and this area is characterized by a drying trend. Regionally, the severe drought years were detected in 2000, 2004, 2005, 2010, 2016, 2019, and 2020, and they were commonly found in Central Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia. The analysis of drought years indicated that the temporal change pattern of drought has shifted from the northern regions (e.g., Central Myanmar) in 2010 to the Lower Mekong region in recent years. The findings of this study provide valuable information for drought early warning management and agricultural planning across mainland Southeast Asia."
101;Hierarchical extraction of cropland boundaries using Sentinel-2 time-series data in fragmented agricultural landscapes;"Wenyao Song a , Chen Wang a , Taifeng Dong b , Zhaohai Wang a , Chengxin Wang a,* , Xiaoda Mu a , Huanxue Zhang a";"Accurately extracting cropland field parcels from satellite data in fragmented agricultural landscapes presents huge challenges due to small field sizes and irregular field shapes. Here, we developed a hierarchical framework for agricultural field boundary extraction from Sentinel-2 satellites based on the concept of the degree in field fragmentation. Our framework focused on three tasks, including a core task for agricultural field extraction and two auxiliary tasks to address special situations in two different fragmented regions, namely the Plains-Basin scenes with relatively regular shapes and diverse crop types, and the Plateau-Hilly scenes, with irregular shapes and small field sizes. First, the field boundaries were delineated using a modified Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network based on U-Net (R2U-Net), and post-processed using morphological filtering and the Douglas-Peucker algorithm (DPA). A rule-based decision fusion strategy assisted with a classification method was developed to address the under-segmentation problem in the Plains-Basin scenes, and an adaptive generalized buffer algorithm (AGBA) was used to address the incomplete-segmentation problem in the Plateau-Hilly scenes. We tested the proposed methods in Yangming County, Heilongjiang Province of China, using time series Sentinel-2 imageries with 10-m spatial resolution. Compared with the results from using R2U-Net or a singletemporal image alone, the fragmented field boundaries show an outstanding performance, with an overall accuracy of 86.42% and 84.15% and F1 score of 0.85 and 0.83 in Plains-Basin scenes and Plateau-Hilly scenes, respectively. Our proposed methods provide a feasible solution to finely extract field boundaries in highly fragmented and heterogeneous agricultural landscapes."
102;Soil properties zoning of agricultural fields based on a climate-driven spatial clustering of remote sensing time series data;"Francesco Reyes a,b , Raffaele Casa a,* , Massimo Tolomio a,c , Michele Dalponte d , Nada Mzid a";"The identification of zones within an agricultural field that respond differently to environmental factors and agronomic management is a key requirement for the adoption of more precise and sustainable agricultural practices. Several approaches based on spatial clustering methods applied to different data sources, e.g. yield maps, proximal sensors and soil surveys, have been proposed in the last decades. The current availability of a huge amount of free remote sensing data allows to apply these approaches to agricultural areas where ground or proximal data are not available. However, in order to provide useful agronomic management information, it is essential that the zoning obtained by clustering is linked to the underlying spatial variability of soil properties. In this work we explore the hypothesis that the response of crop vigor to temporal climate variability, assessed by remote sensing data time series, selected to correspond to specific growth phases and seasonal climate patterns, provides indications on the variability of soil properties within agricultural fields, for both herbaceous and tree crops. NDVI time-series for 38 years (1984?2021) were obtained for fourteen non-irrigated herbaceous and tree crop fields in Central Italy, from multispectral satellites data (Landsat 5/7/8, Sentinel 2). The Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was used to classify time series into three climatic classes (dry/ normal/wet) for five different periods of the growth season, covering the main phenological phases. K-means clustering was used to identify patterns of crop growth from climatically classified image sets, as well as for all the bulked images for comparison (bulk clustering). Clustering results were compared with soil maps obtained from spatialized ground data, for soil texture (clay, silt and sand), soil organic matter and available soil water (ASW). The agreement between the different clustering results and soil maps was assessed by the Adjusted Rand Index. Agreement with soil maps varied depending on the field, the phenological phase considered and the soil property considered. Climate driven clustering from long, late growth season periods best matched soil properties, both for herbaceous and tree crops, despite being based on a limited number of images. The clustering from images spanning a longer growth period for dry years systematically outpaced the bulk clustering for silt, sand and ASW, while the clustering for normal climatic conditions was the best for organic matter. The performance of the matching between clustering and soil maps increased with soil variability significantly more (P < 0.05) than in the bulk clustering (mean slopes respectively 0.468 ? 0.167 0.113 ? 0.270). The integration of the SPEI climatic index into the clustering procedure systematically improved the identification of zones with homogeneous soil properties, highlighting that a greater attention should be posed to the climate-crop-field interactions when using remotely sensed images."

Dynamic modeling based on machine learning methods, e.g., intelligent time series prediction modeling, is a popular and suitable way to solve the above issue. In this article, a systematic literature review on applying advanced time series models has been systematically conducted via a detailed analysis and evaluation of 61 pieces selected from 221 articles. The historical process of time series model application from the use of data and information strategies was first discussed. Subsequently, the accuracy and generalization of the model from the selection of model parameters and time steps, providing a new perspective for model development in this field, were compared and analyzed. Finally, the systematic review results demonstrate that, compared with traditional models, deep neural networks could increase data structure mining capabilities and overall information simulation capabilities through innovative and effective structures, thereby it could also broaden the selection range of environmental parameters for agricultural facilities and achieve environmental prediction end-to-end optimization via intelligent time series model based on deep neural networks."
104;Meta-Statistical Deep Learning for Stochastic Time-Series Prediction in Agricultural Applications;"Christos Bazinas, Chris Lytridis, Vassilis G. Kaburlasos*";"Certain variables of interest in agriculture may preferably be mapped to distributions rather than to real numbers, e.g. the variable ?apple (fruit) weight? on an apple tree at sampling times hence, a stochastic time-series emerges. Since a cumulative probability distribution can be represented by a Type-1 Intervals? Number (IN) in the mathematical lattice (F1, ?), this work considers a stochastic time-series F : R ? F1 and interprets it as a parametric Type-2 IN, symbolically F(x t). Given samples F(x ti), i = k, the problem here is to predict F(x, ti) for i > k, assuming a deterministic relation among samples F(x ti), i ? {1, ..., n}. Prediction is pursued by a novel neural architecture, namely meta-Statistical IN Neural Network, or metaStatINNN for short, consisting of two neural modules in series: The first one, namely lowerNN, induces INs from data using deep learning whereas, the second one, namely upperNN, is a well known INNN (IN Neural Network) that implements a function f : FN 1 ? F1. This preliminary work considers a benchmark time-series of temperature distributions as well as artificial data sets of increasing cardinality. Computational experiments are demonstrated comparatively to a conventional neural network. The results by metaStatINNN are superior not only in terms of computational speed as well as prediction accuracy but also because a conventional neural network typically predicts only first-order data statistics, whereas the metaStatINNN may predict all-order data statistics in addition, the metaStatINNN can explain its answers moreover, an IN can represent big data."
105;Trigonometric-Euclidean-Smoother Interpolator (TESI) for continuous time-series and non-time-series data augmentation for deep neural network applications in agriculture;"Radhwane Derraz a , Farrah Melissa Muharam a,* , Noraini Ahmad Jaafar b , Ng Keng Yap c";"Biomass estimation, fertilisation, and crop production reflect crop yield potential. The prediction of these variables allows the selection of crop cultivars with high yield potential. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can predict such crop variables. However, DNNs are data greedy algorithms that overfit/underfit on small-size datasets. Additionally, the collection of big data is expensive and laborious. Therefore, providing synthetic big data is preferable. This study aims to: (i) develop a trigonometric-Euclidean-smoother interpolation (TESI) for continuous time-series and non-time-series data augmentation to prevent DNNs from under/overfitting (ii) compare the TESI performance to the tabular variational autoencoder (TVAE) and the conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) and (iii) compare the DNN performance before and after data augmentation. Two time-series datasets, oil palm production and rice production, and two non-time-series datasets, fertiliser and rice total aboveground biomass (TAGB), were augmented using the TESI, TVAE, and CTGAN algorithms. The TESI retained the features? original probability distribution in the four datasets. The C-TESI achieved the lowest mean squared error mean percentage (MAEP) on the oil palm (0.60?2.85%), rice (0.77?1.72%), and fertiliser datasets (2.04?2.21%). The TESI retained the variance inflation factor (VIF) ranges less than 10 on the four datasets the TESI retained a VIF range of 1.99?10.06 or reduced the VIF range to 1.55?6.66. Furthermore, the TESI retained the Spearman?s r (rs) range of 0.79?0.97 or increased it to 0.81?0.99 on the four datasets. The DNN achieved the highest coefficient of determination (R2 ) (0.77?0.99) and lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) ranges (2.8E+01?8.1E+05) on the four datasets augmented with the TESI. The Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI overcame the LN-TESI in retaining the features? original probability distribution, minimising the augmentation loss, reducing the VIF, increasing the rs, and decreasing the DNN under/overfitting. The Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI may approximate the nonlinear changes of crop phenology in time-spaced sampling, thereby reducing the cost of sampling for scientists. In addition, they intensify zonal synthetic sampling, thereby reducing sampling labour."
106;"Estimating solute travel times from time series of nitrate concentration in groundwater: Application to a small agricultural catchment in Brittany, France";"Baibaswata Bhaduri a,* , M Sekhar a,b , Ophelie Fovet c , Laurent Ruiz b,c,d";"Stream flow and concentration dynamics are usually supposed to integrate the diverse hydrological and biogeochemical processes occurring within catchments and their variability in space and time. Proxies like transit times and young water fractions are often used to understand this variability. However, this procedure might not be suitable in catchments with ephemeral streams. The objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that in catchments where groundwater flow is the main source of water output, solute travel times can be inferred from the monitored groundwater levels and solute concentration time series of piezometer networks. We used data from a well-studied small agricultural catchment in Brittany, belonging to the French network of Critical Zone Observatories. The data set includes long-term nitrate concentration time-series measured both at the stream outlet and the network of piezometers. We applied a parsimonious, conceptual dual-permeability mixing modelto calibrate our dataset and found that the nitrate travel times estimated in mid to upslope piezometers were consistently higher than the one at the stream outlet. We further observed an asynchronicity in seasonal concentration-discharge dynamics between the piezometers and the stream. We hypothesized that either due to riparian denitrification and uptake by vegetation, a pronounced seasonality is being generated which is making our model underestimate the nitrate travel times at the stream, or the piezometers are acting as proxies to the slower conceptual store of our mixing model, and shallow subsurface flow or some hydrologically significant heterogeneities are contributing to the faster route which is not tapped into by the piezometer network. Latter hypothesis is further supported by the fact that nitrate travel velocity along two different transects are in agreement with the slower conceptual store of our model. Nevertheless, we established that to specifically estimate the groundwater travel time of a catchment, a piezometer free from riparian influence alongside a stream is very beneficial."
107;"Observed time series trend analysis of climate variability and smallholder adoption of new agricultural technologies in west Shewa, Ethiopia";"Daniel Assefa Tofu* , Mesfin Mengistu";"This study was aimed at analyzing time-series trends and variability analysis of observed rainfall and temperature records from 16 stations during the 1985?2015 period. Besides, it focused on the smallholders? perceptions, including the analysis of their response strategies to both observed and perceived climate variability and its determinants. Both purposive and random sampling procedures were used. Mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) of the research were used. The sample household survey method was used to collect primary data from smallholder farmers, while key informant interviews were used to gather qualitative data from the experts. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data, whereas a discussion guide checklist was used to gather qualitative data. A total of 397 respondents and 24 key informants were used as sources of primary data. In addition, visits to the National Meteorology Agency of Ethiopia were made to collect recorded climate data. Descriptive statistics and econometric models were used to analyze quantitative data, whereas thematic categorization was used to analyze and report qualitative data. The results show that both the summer and annual rainfall have an increasing trend but are not statistically significant. With regards to variability, low to moderate levels of variability were recorded according to the seasons and annual rainfall. The result of the Mann-Kendall test shows that the mean minimum temperature was raised by 0.05 ?C while the maximum temperature rose by 0.03 ?C/30 years. The monthly maximum temperature also shows an increasing trend, with the lowest record during August (22.05 ?C) and the highest in March (26.49 ?C. Besides, smallholder farmers? perceptions were in accordance with recorded station data. In response to both observed and perceived climate variability and its extremes, smallholder farmers in the study area were striving to adopt different adaptation strategies. Rain variability, frequency of extension contact, years of farming experience, access to institutions and infrastructure, wealth status, market access, and the number of active labor force within the household all hampered smallholder farmers? efforts to implement potential measures. In contrast, the high prices of chemicals and improved seed, access to credit services, land size, and limited access to accurate and timely early warning information all negatively and significantly influenced the adaptation decisions of smallholder farmers in the area. Therefore, the impacts of abnormal trends or shifts in observed rainfall and temperature patterns, along with socio-economic, technological, and behavioral factors, call for policymakers to set strategies that will enable smallholders to improve their livelihoods, ensure food security, and build resilience in the face of climatic extremes."
108;Mapping soil organic carbon stock by hyperspectral and time-series multispectral remote sensing images in low-relief agricultural areas;"Long Guo a,f , Xiaoru Sun a , Peng Fu b , Tiezhu Shi c , Lina Dang a , Yiyun Chen d , M. Linderman e , Ganlin Zhang f , Yu Zhang g,* , Qinghu Jiang h,* , Haitao Zhang a,* , Chen Zeng a";"High-precision digital soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks mapping is very important for agricultural production management and global carbon cycle. The spatial heterogeneity of farmland SOC is not only influence by the environmental factors of soil formation but also the management practices of tillage, fertilization, and irrigation. However, the traditional modeling covariates of digital soil mapping, such as terrain factors, land use types and climate factors have weak spatial variations in low-relief agricultural areas, and they cannot reflect the large spatial variation of SOC. Thus the time-series multispectral remote sensing images will be used for mapping soil properties in low relief regions in this study, meanwhile a new collaborative verification strategy was put forward to evaluate the spatial distribution characteristics of soil maps. The current study was performed in a nearly flat agricultural region southeast of Iowa (with an area of approximately 385.45 ha), where 195 surface soil samples (0?15 cm) were collected. A hyperspectral image (Headwall-Hyperspec, 380?1700 nm) and the timeseries multispectral remote sensing images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 were used to construct the prediction models of SOC stock and its relevant soil properties of SOC and soil bulk density (SBD) through partial least square regression (PLSR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. The collected soil samples and evaluation indexes of root mean square error (RMSE), R2 , and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) were used to evaluate the model performance. Results are as follows: (1) hyperspectral images were successfully used to predict the SOC stock, SOC, and SBD through PLSR and ELM, while ELM (RPIQ = 2.03, 1.97, 1.64) outperformed PLSR (RPIQ = 1.83, 1.97, 1.53) (2) the time-series multispectral remote sensing images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 can reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of the SOC stock, SOC and SBD by PLSR and ELM, but the combination of Sentinel 2 images and ELM obtained the best prediction results (RPIQ = 1.45, 1.25, 1.26) and (3) the differences of the soil maps predicted by the hyperspectral image and time-series multispectral remote sensing images were small, and the largest percentage errors nearly appeared on the edges of the farmland patches owing to mixed pixels. This study further confirmed the good prediction abilities of the time-series multispectral remote sensing images in low relief farmland regions. Lastly, this mapping strategy can provide additional valuable information for agricultural management and carbon cycle."
109;Exploring influence factors in mapping soil organic carbon on low-relief agricultural lands using time series of remote sensing data;"Long Guo a , Peng Fu b , Tiezhu Shi c , Yiyun Chen d , Chen Zeng a , Haitao Zhang a , Shanqin Wang a, *";"Soil organic carbon (SOC) content is of critical importance in managing agricultural fields and understanding carbon fluxes at various scales. At regional and global scales, digital mapping of SOC has been successful using environmental variables such as climatic, land use and terrain factors. However, such a mapping for agricultural lands in low-relief areas cannot be resolved due to weak spatial variations of the environmental variables. An alternative approach, based on time series of remote sensing images, has recently been emphasized in estimating SOC since crop growth status clearly revealed by satellite images is strongly related to SOC. However, there is still a lack of full understanding of impacts of factors such as data source, regression techniques, and spatial resolution on the accuracy of SOC mapping using time series of satellite images. In this study, prediction variables including four spectral bands (i.e., blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel 2, Gaofen (GF) 1, and Landsat 8 data, acquired between November 2017 to March 2018, were individually used to estimate SOC by stepwise regression (STR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Besides, we further explored the influence of satellite parameters, such as scanning time, spectral bands and vegetation indices on predicting SOC using Sentinel 2 time series images. Results showed that: (1) the time series of remote sensing images can be used to map SOC in smalland large-extent low-relief areas with low evaluated root mean square errors (0.199 % and 0.249 %) and high R2 (0.555 and 0.528), (2) SOC estimations from the Sentinel-2 time series images, compared to those from Landsat 8 and GF 1 datasets, exhibited a better accuracy, and the ELM yielded a better prediction accuracy than PLSR and STR, (3) the satellite parameters of the spatial resolution, the acquisition time and the spectral bands significantly affected the prediction accuracy. This study offers more comprehensive information than terrain factors for revealing the influence of satellite parameters on predicting SOC, and provides great help for constructing one more suitable and higher precision soil mapping strategy for agricultural lands in low-relief areas."
110;"Land use mosaics in Mediterranean rainfed agricultural areas as an indicator of collective crop successions: Insights from a land use time series study conducted in Cap Bon, Tunisia";"Anne Biarn`es a,* , Jean-St?ephane Bailly a,b , Insaf Mekki c , Intissar Ferchichi c";"CONTEXT: In cultivated landscapes, land use patterns related to the diversity of crops, their spatial arrangement into patches and their succession over several years influence many biophysical processes and the production of ecosystem services and disservices. Understanding the determinants of these patterns is a prerequisite for the development of acceptable alternative land use patterns. Most studies deem crop distribution patterns at the landscape level to be the result of individual allocations of crop successions to fields designed at the farm level. However, in some parts of the world, there are collective crop successions that apply to groups of adjacent fields on different farms. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the extent to which the spatiotemporal distribution of crops at the landscape scale relates to collective crop successions. METHODS: The study was based on a Mediterranean rainfed agricultural landscape (67.7 km2 ) located in northeastern Tunisia, in which collective successions respond to constraints related to agricultural land fragmentation. Combined with field mapping, remotely sensed land use time series were used to identify three-year crop sequences, classify them into crop succession types and identify clusters of adjacent fields with the same type of crop succession. We assumed that such a cluster was the result of a collective succession if thedeterminants of the individual crop succession locations did not explain its size (expressed in the number of fields). We related such determinants to the characteristics of the fields and their land-use environment and defined them statistically. Then, we developed a spatial permutation test to distinguish clusters  esulting only from the determinants of the individual crop succession locations from those resulting from collective succession. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the collective successions mainly comprised biennial successions (wheat sown alternately with legumes, spices or forage crops). These successions were synchronized between adjacent fields based on wheat cultivation all fields in the same cluster had wheat in the same year. Collective successions were secondarily comprised of fodder-dominant successions. These collective successions involved approximately 40% of the fields and their total area in the study area. These fields belonged to different clusters ranging in size from two to 96 adjacent fields. SIGNIFICANCE: The developed approach is a tool for mapping the likely presence of collective successions and considering this factor in the definition of sustainable land use scenarios at the landscape level for better soil and water management.

111;Monitoring of agricultural drought in semi-arid ecosystem of Peninsular India through indices derived from time-series CHIRPS and MODIS datasets;"P. Sandeep a,b , G.P. Obi Reddy a,* , R. Jegankumar b , K.C. Arun Kumar a,b";"The reliable and consistent remote sensing-based drought indices along with Geographic Information System (GIS) play a significant role in the mapping, and monitoring of agricultural drought. The core objective of the present study is to monitor agricultural drought dynamics over the semi-arid Rayalaseema region of Peninsular India during the year 2000 to 2018 by using the Normalized Vegetation Supply Water Index (NVSWI) derived from time-series remote sensing data products. NVSWI is the normalization of Vegetation Supply Water Index (VSWI), which was computed by integrating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST). The analysis of Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) shows that in dry year (2001), majority of the study area experienced extreme dry conditions (SPI < - 2.0) due to the deficit rainfall during the growing season. The spatio-temporal analysis of NVSWI reveals that the western, central, and northern parts of the study area were prone to frequent droughts of moderate to severe intensity. The high temperatures and below normal rainfall are found to be the major triggering factors for the droughts in the region. During the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2014, 2017, and 2018 worst droughts were observed in the study region. The Pearson correlation analysis between monthly NVSWI with 1-month SPI and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) for the growing season of dry (2001) and wet (2007) years clearly show a significant positive correlation. The study clearly demonstrates the potential of NVSWI as one of the robust indices in the assessment and monitoring of agricultural droughts."
112;Agricultural erosion modelling: Evaluating USLE and WEPP field-scale erosion estimates using UAV time-series data;"Benjamin U. Meinen * , Derek T. Robinson";"Soil erosion models, typically applied at basin and watershed scales, are rarely evaluated at agricultural field scales due to the lack of spatially-distributed time series data. A novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) methodology was used to quantify farm-field soil erosion from nine UAV surveys and structure-from-motion (SfM). Using a semi-distributed approach, we evaluated soil erosion estimates from the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP). The annual erosion rate, measured with the UAV methodology, was 18.83 t ha- 1 yr- 1 , with USLE and WEPP predictions of 26.23 t ha- 1 yr- 1 and 16.41 t ha- 1 yr- 1 , respectively. Modelled annual and sub-annual erosion rates with WEPP were within the upper-limit of predictive accuracy, while the USLE tended to systematically overestimate soil erosion rates. These outcomes have implications on the efficacy of conservation efforts, which is highlighted through a discussion and comparison of different best-management practice applications."

Leit?b,d , Patrick Hostertb,c";"The paradox between environmental conservation and economic development is a challenge for Brazil, where there is a complex and dynamic agricultural scenario. This reinforces the need for effective methods for the detailed mapping of agriculture. In this work, we employed land surface phenological metrics derived from dense satellite image time series to classify agricultural land in the Cerrado biome. We used all available Landsat images between April 2013 and April 2017, applying a weighted ensemble of Radial Basis Function (RBF) convolution filters as a kernel smoother to fill data gaps such as cloud cover and Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off data. Through this approach, we created a dense Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data cube with an 8-day temporal resolution and derived phenometrics for a Random Forest (RF) classification. We used a hierarchical classification with four levels, from land cover to crop rotation classes. Most of the classes showed accuracies higher than 90%. Single crop and Non-commercial crop classes presented lower accuracies. However, we showed that phenometrics derived from dense Landsat-like image time series, in a hierarchical classification scheme, has a great potential for detailed agricultural mapping. The results are promising and show that the method is consistent and robust, being applicable to mapping agricultural land throughout the entire Cerrado"
114;On the enrichment of time series with textual data for forecasting agricultural commodity prices;"Ivan JosReis Filhoa,b,* , Ricardo Marcondes Marcacini b , Solange Oliveira Rezende b";"Forecasting models in the financial market generally use quantitative time-series data. However, external factors can influence data in time-series, such as weather events, economic crises, and the foreign exchange market. This information is not explicit in the time-series and can influence the prediction of the variable values. Textual data can be a source of knowledge about external factors and is potentially helpful for time-series forecasting models. Some studies have presented text mining techniques to combine textual and time-series data. However, the existing representations have limitations, such as the curse of dimensionality and sparse data. This work investigates the finite use of domain-specific terms to investigate these problems by representing textual data with low dimensional space. We consider thirty-three keywords that are potentially important in the domain to enrich time-series using text mining techniques. Four regression models were applied to the representation proposed to predict the future daily price of corn and soybeans. The experimental setup considers a real market scenario, in which the daily sliding window strategy and step-forward forecast were used. The representation proposed has better accuracy in some forecasting scenarios. The results indicate that text data are a promising alternative for enriching time-series representations and reducing uncertainty forecasting models."

Skaggsc , Mohamed Allalie , Dennis L. Corwinc";"Testing soil salinity assessment methodologies over different regions is important for future continental and global scale applications. A novel regional-scale soil salinity modeling approach using plant-performance metrics was proposed by Zhang et al. (2015) for farmland in the Yellow River Delta, China, a region with a humid continental/subtropical climate. The one-year integral of temporally interpolated MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series data was proposed as an explanatory variable for agricultural soil salinity modeling. Here, we test such a methodology in California?s Central Valley, USA, a region with a semi-arid Mediterranean climate. Time series of EVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Canopy Response Salinity Index (CRSI) were created for the 2007?2013 period. Seventy-three MODIS pixels surveyed for 0?1.2-m soil salinity in 2013 were used as the ground-truth dataset. Our results validate the tested approach: the 2013 integral of CRSI (best performing index) had a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of -0.699 with salinity. Results obtained using temporally integrated data were almost always better than those obtained using individual data. Furthermore, we show that the methodology can be improved by the use of multi-year data. Further research is needed to improve spatial resolution and the selection of vegetation indices"
116;"Multi-faceted land cover and land use change analyses in the Yellow River Basin based on dense Landsat time series: Exemplary analysis in mining, agriculture, forest, and urban areas";"Christian Wohlfart a, b, * , Benjamin Mack b , Gaohuan Liu c , Claudia Kuenzer b";"The Yellow River Basin is one of Chinas most dynamic regions, where past and recent anthropogenic land use activities and polices have had a remarkably impact on the basins surface. Over the past decades, the rapid socio-economic development has increased the pressure on the prevailing water and land resources with various repercussions on the environment and society. Counteracting ecological degradation in the basin, large-scale conservation and restoration plans have been initiated to expand vegetation coverage on deteriorated land, simultaneously fostering rural sustainable agriculture production. In this context, we derived precise spatial thematic products from long-term satellite timeseries about high-frequency temporal dynamics. This information, available in a consistent and repeatable fashion is rare and relevant for many regional and local stakeholders and must be monitored annually to capture the rapid rate of change. Such information serves as a valuable base for decisionmaking processes. In this study, we used all the archived Landsat images between 2000 and 2015 (4520 scenes) to computed annually the spatially continuous spectral-temporal and textual metrics based on dense Landsat time-series to derive annual maps showing the most prominent land-cover change types related to mining, agriculture, forestry, and urbanization in four sub-regions spread over the Yellow River Basin. These novel land cover/use products provide new insights into recent regional and local dynamics. For final classification, we employed random forest classifiers for each thematic focus-region, trained and tested based on a stable-pixels data set. The resulting maps achieved high accuracies and show afforestation on the Loess Plateau and urbanization as the most prominent drivers of land use/cover dynamics. Agricultural land remained stable, showing local small-scale dynamics. Our study highlights the great potential of using consistent spectral-temporal metrics derived from dense Landsat time-series data together with a stable pixels reference set, allowing for local and regional land surface dynamics mapping at high spatial resolution and the prediction of implications of future change for effective and sustainable basin management."
117;Application of spatial EOF and multivariate time series model for evaluating agricultural drought vulnerability in Korea;"Kim Dae Ha a , Yoo Chulsang a,? , Kim Tae-Woong b";"This study proposed a methodology using the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and multivariate time series model for the analysis of drought both in time and space. The methodology proposed was then applied to evaluate the vulnerability of agricultural drought of major river basins in Korea. First, the three-month SPI data from 59 rain gauge stations over the Korean Peninsula were analyzed by deriving and spatially characterizing the EOFs. The shapes of major estimated EOFs were found to well reflect the observed spatial pattern of droughts. Second, the coefficient time series of estimated EOFs were then fitted by a multivariate time series model to generate the SPI data for 10,000 years, which were used to derive the annual maxima series of areal average drought severity over the Korean Peninsula. These annual maxima series were then analyzed to determine the mean drought severity for given return periods. Four typical spatial patterns of drought severity could also be selected for those return periods considered. This result shows that the southern part of the Korean Peninsula is most vulnerable to drought than the other parts. Finally, the agricultural drought vulnerability was evaluated by considering the potential water supply from dams. In an ideal case, when all the maximum dam storage was assumed to be assigned to agriculture, all river basins in Korea were found to have the potential to overcome a 30-year drought. However, under more realistic conditions considering average dam storage and water allocation priorities, most of the river basins could not overcome a 30-year drought."
118;Performance Analysis of the Regression and Time Series Predictive Models using Parallel Implementation for Agricultural Data;"Balaji Prabhu B Va *, M Dakshayinib";"The profit and loss of any type of business depends on the effective decision making and predictive models playvery important role in making wise decisions in all cases. Agriculture is also a kind business, where the farmers need to make the timely decisions in crop selection to make the farm business more useful and profitable. In developing countries like India, farmers are failing to make theright decision at right time to make the profitable farm business. An efficient predictive model based system could definitely help the farmers in making appropriate timely decisions in crop selection and thereby minimizing the loss. Hence there is a need for an efficient predictive model that can effectively deal with Big-data. As there are many predictive models existing, the performance of these models needs to be analyzed to select the more appropriate and effective model based on the application with the increasing data size. This paper proposes and implements a parallel predictive model for potentially forecasting the demand, supply and price values of the agricultural commodities. The forecasted values of various models are compared with the actual market values and analyzed the performance to select the best"
119;"Extraction of agricultural phenological parameters of Sri Lanka using MODIS, NDVI time series data";"W.G.N.N Jayawardhanaa *, V.M.I Chathurangeb";"Management of crops is an essential part in the food production procedure. Having a thorough knowledge of growth stages of each crop is of paramount importance in this respect. Phenology (transplanting, panicle formation, flowering etc) is the study of cyclic and seasonal natural phenomena that are controlled by environmental and climatic factors. Monitoring the crop condition manually in the field is difficult and time consuming. Therefore recently, several methods have been introduced by using satellite derived vegetation indices. Extraction of phenological parameters is helpful for the purposes like irrigation management, nutrient management, health management, yield prediction and crop type mapping. Easily extracted parameters will be the important data base for agricultural researchers. This research is an attempt to extract paddy phenological parameters of Sri Lanka by using 16 years? (2000 to 2015) Time series MODIS Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is highly sensitive for the green vegetation and the data were analysed using SPIRITS and TIMESAT software?s. Periodicity converter in SPIRITS and Savitzky Golay filtering in TIMESAT and SPIRITS are helpful in smoothing the time series which are perturbed by noise due to missing values and Clouds. Phenology is considered as a sensitive climate change indicator but, it is very essential to have a comprehensive familiarity about the method of water supply that the study area is irrigated or rain fed so as to eliminate the wrong interpretation. As results, average of long time series of NDVI profile for a few agro ecological zones of Sri Lanka with extracted seven parameters (Start of the season, End of the season, Length of the season, Booting date, Base value, Maximum NDVI during the Season, Amplitude) and generated phenological parameter maps are presented here. The crop phenology is a very important element of agricultural monitoring, to ensure the security of the food crop production."
120;Image time series processing for agriculture monitoring;"Herman Eerens a , Dominique Haesen a , Felix Rembold b , Ferdinando Urbano b,*, Carolien Tote a , Lieven Bydekerke a";"Given strong year-to-year variability, increasing competition for natural resources, and climate change impacts on agriculture, monitoring global crop and natural vegetation conditions is highly relevant, particularly in food insecure areas. Data from remote sensing image series at high temporal and low spatial resolution can help to assist in this monitoring as they provide key information in near-real time over large areas. The SPIRITS software, presented in this paper, is a stand-alone toolbox developed for environmental monitoring, particularly to produce clear and evidence-based information for crop production analysts and decision makers. It includes a large number of tools with the main aim of extracting vegetation indicators from image time series, estimating the potential impact of anomalies on crop production and sharing this information with different audiences. SPIRITS offers an integrated and flexible analysis environment with a user-friendly graphical interface, which allows sequential tasking and a high level of automation of processing chains. It is freely distributed for non-commercial use and extensively documented."
121;"The effects of climate variability and the color of weather time series on agricultural diseases and pests, and on decisions for their management";"K.A. Garrett a,*, A.D.M. Dobsonb, J. Kroschel c, B. Natarajand, S. Orlandini e, H.E.Z. Tonnangc, C. Valdiviaf";"If climate change scenarios include higher variance in weather variables, this can have important effects on pest and disease risk beyond changes in mean weather conditions. We developed a theoretical model of yield loss to diseases and pests as a function of weather, and used this model to evaluate the effects of variance in conduciveness to loss and the effects of the color of time series of weather conduciveness to loss. There were two qualitatively different results for changes in system variance. If median conditions are conducive to loss, increasing system variance decreases mean yield loss. On the other hand, if median conditions are intermediate or poor for disease or pest development, such that conditions are conducive to yield loss no more than half the time, increasing system variance increases mean yield loss. Time series for weather conduciveness that are darker pink (have higher levels of temporal autocorrelation) produce intermediate levels of yield loss less commonly. A linked model of decision-making based on either past or current information about yield loss also shows changes in the performance of decision rules as a function of system variance. Understanding patterns of variance can improve scenario analysis for climate change and help make adaptation strategies such as decision support systems and insurance programs more effective."
122;Detecting gradual and abrupt changes in water quality time series in response to regional payment programs for watershed services in an agricultural area;"Tian He, Yan Lu ? , Yanping Cui, Yabo Luo, Min Wang, Wei Meng, Kaijie Zhang, Feifei Zhao";"Market-based watershed protection instruments can effectively improve water quality at various catchment scales. Two payments for watershed services (PWS) programs for water quality improvement have been successively implemented in the Huai River catchment and its sub-watershed, the Shaying River catchment, in Henan Province since 2009. To detect changes in water quality in response to PWS schemes, nonparametric statistical approaches were used to analyze gradual and abrupt trends in water quality, focusing on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) at 26 monitoring stations in the Huai River watershed during 2006?2013. The nonparametric Mann?Kendall test and the Theil?Sen estimator were used to identify trends and their magnitudes in weekly water quality observations and the Pettitt test was applied to change-point analysis of water quality time series. We found decreasing concentration trends in the weekly water quality data set in this catchment, with water quality at most stations affected by the PWS schemes. The COD and NH3-N concentrations decreased at 26 stations by an average of 0.05 mg/L wk and 0.01 mg/L wk, respectively, from 2006 to 2013. Meanwhile, the mean concentrations of COD and NH3-N decreased at the 26 stations by an average of 18.03 mg/L and 4.82 mg/L, respectively, after the abrupt change points of the time-series trends of these two pollutants. We also estimated annual reductions in COD and NH3-N for each station based on average flow observations using the Theil?Sen approach along with the resulting economic benefits from 2009 to 2010. The COD and NH3-N reductions were 14604.50 and 6213.25 t/y, respectively, in the Huai River catchment in Henan Province. The total economic benefits of reductions in these two pollutants were 769.71 million ? in 2009 and 2010, accounting for 0.08% and 0.06%, respectively, of the GDP in the entire Huai River watershed of Henan Province. These results provide new insights into the linkages between PWS programs and water quality improvements at regional and local scales for effective management of water resources."
123;"Innovation, natural resources abundance, climate change and green growth in agriculture";"Xiaocong Ren, Jun He, Zilong Huang *";"The growing concerns over climate change and the existence of the resource curse hypothesis in several resourcerich countries highlight the importance of green growth. Similarly, promoting green growth in agriculture is essential for addressing environmental problems, realizing sustainable development, and building a sustainable future. However, none of the studies emphasized the specific phenomena of the agriculture sector. Therefore, the core objective of this paper is to explore the role of innovation, natural resource abundance, and climate change in promoting green growth in the agriculture sector of China. The study used time series data ranging from 1970 to 2021 and applied cointegration and spectral causality techniques for empirical investigation. Robustness of the results was ensured using Bayesian regression. The findings of the study indicated that innovation significantly improves green growth in agriculture. It is also found that the proxy of climate change also plays a significant positive role in the green growth of agriculture. Conversely, the role of natural resource abundance in green agricultural growth has been found to be negative, which confirms the existence of a resource curse in the agriculture sector of China. Notably, all variables in the model demonstrated a positive impact on green growth in agriculture, except for natural resource abundance. The findings provide reasonable insights for policy development related to innovation, natural resources, and agriculture sector growth. The study concludes with key suggestions for policy formulation."
124;Links between US and Turkish agricultural commodity Markets: Nonlinear dependence and tail risk;"Zehra Atik a , Bulent Guloglu ? a , Necla Ilter Kucukcolak b";"In these unprecedented times, marred by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, global warming, and the war in Ukraine that began in February 2022, new approaches such as tail dependence have attracted more interest than conventional market dependence methodologies in analyzing time series in order to evaluate market linkage. In this study, we use the tail-restricted integrated regression function (IRF), introduced as a new methodology for nonlinear tail-mean dependence analysis. The IRF approach has several advantages over the existing tail-dependence measures focused solely on the occurrence of single tail events. To examine market dependence and tail risk, we analyze the nexus between the US and Turkish agricultural commodity markets over the period January 5, 2016?May 31, 2022. In addition to the daily prices of barley, corn, and wheat on agricultural commodity markets, we use Brent oil as a representative for the energy market, interest, and foreign exchange rates for financial markets as variables in our study. The results of upside and downside asymmetric risk spillovers show the direction of impact from the US agricultural market to the Turkish agricultural market. The findings suggest that, following the launch of a spot market in Turkiye, the launch of an ? agricultural commodity futures market will enhance the completeness and the link between the spot and derivatives markets there"
125;Nitrogen and phosphorus losses in Nordic and Baltic agricultural monitoring catchments ? Spatial and temporal variations in relation to natural conditions and mitigation programmes;"Katarina Kyllmar a,* , Marianne Bechmann b , Gitte Blicher-Mathiesen c , Franziska Katharina Fischer b , Jens Folster ? d , Arvo Iital e , Ainis Lagzdin??sf , Arvydas Povilaitis g , Katri Rankinen h";"Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses via agricultural drainage water have negative impacts on receiving water bodies and large-scale programmes to reduce nutrient losses have been established in the Nordic and Baltic countries, together with agricultural catchment monitoring programmes. This study evaluated time series (9?40 years) of data from 34 selected Nordic-Baltic catchments for spatial and temporal variations in area-specific water discharge (mm) and in concentrations and transport of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Water discharge from the catchments varied from 125 mm (Denmark) to > 1000 mm (Norway). Catchments with low TN concentrations (=3 mg L-1) were dominated by clay or grass leys or were undrained with reduction of nitrate (NO3) in shallow groundwater. Catchments with high TN concentrations (=10 mg L-1) had loams and cereal crops. TP concentrations were highest (=0.45 mg L-1) in catchments with erosive soils, relatively high water discharge and cereal crops, and lowest (=0.07 mg L-1) in catchments with permeable soils. Generalised additive mixed model (GAMM) analysis of time series of transport and flow-weighted concentrations of TN and TP for temporal patterns revealed decreases in TN concentrations in seven catchments and increases in eight, while four had periods with opposing trends. TN concentrations decreased in Denmark and Sweden in 1990?2010, following introduction of mitigation programmes. TP concentrations decreased in eight catchments and increased in six, while one showed opposing trends. Decreases in TP coincided with improved P balance in catchments with sand and loam. To further reduce N and P losses, a tailored set of mitigation measures is needed for each combination of soil, climate, geohydrology and agricultural production. Intensive monitoring of small catchments can reveal how N and P losses relate to natural conditions and to changes in agricultural production"

127;From meteorological to agricultural drought: Propagation time and probabilistic linkages;"Zhengguang Xu a,b , Zhiyong Wu a,c,* , Quanxi Shao d , Hai He a , Xiao Guo a";"Study region: Yangtze River Basin, China Study focus: As agricultural drought originates from meteorological drought, exploring the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought is an important step in providing early warning of agricultural drought. In this study, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Improved Soil Moisture Anomaly Percentage Index (ISMAPI) were adopted to indicate meteorological and agricultural droughts, respectively. The propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought was identified, and probabilistic linkages between the two types of drought were investigated using the copula function and Bayesian network. New hydrological insights: The average propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) is 48 d. The propagation times in the summer and autumn are shorter than those in the spring and winter. The occurrence probability of more serious agricultural drought gradually increases with meteorological drought intensity. Agricultural and meteorological drought events were matched using the proposed drought eventmatching method. In the YRB, approximately 72.4% of meteorological drought events may translate into agricultural drought events. Generally, an agricultural drought event that has the same drought category as that of the given meteorological drought event is most likely to occur. Regional differences in drought propagation time and occurrence probability of agricultural drought may be related to variations in climatic conditions across regions."
128;An econometric analysis of Greenhouse gas emissions from different agricultural factors in Bangladesh;"Asif Raihana,* , Dewan Ahmed Muhtasimb , Sadia Farhanac , Md Ahsan Ul Hasanb , Monirul Islam Pavel b , Omar Faruk b , Mostafizur Rahmand , Abir Mahmoodd";"Global climate change triggered by greenhouse gases (GHGs) puts incomparable threats to the environment and food security. Agriculture is one of the key drivers of environmental deterioration, which is linked to GHG emissions and labeled ultrasensitive to climate change. However, there is a scarcity of research exploring the nexus between agriculture and GHG emissions in Bangladesh. Thus, the present study empirically investigates the dynamic impacts of agricultural land expansion, agricultural value added, crop production, livestock production, fisheries production, energy use in agriculture, fertilizer consumption, and forest land on GHG emissions in Bangladesh. Time series data from 1990 to 2018 were utilized by employing the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) approach. The empirical findings reveal that a 1% increase in agricultural land, crop production index, livestock production index, fisheries production, energy use in agriculture, and fertilizer consumption will increase GHG emissions by 0.25%, 0.29%, 0.40%, 0.18%, 0.46%, and 0.28% in the long run. Conversely, a 1% increase in agricultural value added and the forest land may lead to GHG emissions reduction by 0.32% and 1.44% in the long run. The estimated results are robust to alternative estimators such as fully modified least squares (FMOLS) and canonical cointegrating regression (CCR). This research contributes to the existing literature by shedding light on the GHG emissions from the agriculture sector of Bangladesh. This article put forward policy recommendations on sustainable and climate-smart agriculture that would enhance productivity and resilience while reducing emissions from the agriculture sector."
129;Potential application of artificial intelligence to the alpha and gamma radiation from agricultural byproducts used as building and construction materials;"Solomon Oyebisi a,* , Thamer Alomayri b";"Recycled agricultural wastes are being used in the building and construction sector as cement additives as a result of the environmental impact of cement production. Agricultural byproducts, on the other hand, are naturally occurring radioactive elements that could expose people and the environment to radiation dangers. As a result, this research assesses the radiological characteristics of agricultural byproducts utilized as building and construction materials with special attention to their activity concentrations (226Ra series, 232Th series, and 40K isotopes). The levels of alpha and gamma radiation were measured via the activity concentrations. Alpha and gamma radiation (output data) and activity concentrations (input data) were trained using artificial intelligence techniques, and the model?s effectiveness was evaluated. In terms of the metrics of the model, the linear regression algorithm outperformed other algorithms. Finally, none of the agricultural byproducts studied are at risk from alpha and gamma radiation. Thus, the findings provide the reference information needed to build a framework for radiation monitoring of surveyed agricultural byproducts."

Nazmul Islam f";"This paper examines energy and agricultural commodities? short-run and long-run connectedness by using the Time-varying parameter vector autoregressions (TVP-VAR). It applies the frequency version of the TVP-VAR model, which is a modified version of the dynamic TVP-VAR model. The frequency decomposition definition also decomposes into short-run and long-run connectedness. We further the analysis by investigating the effect of asymmetry in returns on connectedness. It also examines how portfolio management strategies would lead to a maximization of profits with minimal risks. Empirical evidence indicates that only 32.52% and 31.38% of connectedness in oil and gas, respectively, are transmitted to agricultural commodities, which suggests their weak tendencies in influencing agricultural commodities the total connectedness index hovers around 40?60% in the 2018?2019 period however, it dropped below 40% in 2020?2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to disintegrate the connectedness between energy and agricultural commodities but increased further during the 2022 Russia-Ukraine saga. The findings also indicate that corn, wheat, and flour are net transmitters of risks to oil and natural gas in the long and short-run, and wheat-flour pairwise connectedness is the strongest in the connectedness. Asymmetry is also pronounced in the network of connectedness. Portfolio analyses indicate that investors require a low proportion of energy in a portfolio of energy-agricultural commodities to achieve an optimum profit. The findings will offer exciting insights into the connectedness of agricultural and energy commodities, particularly during periods of high price uncertainty."
131;Detecting the long-term spatiotemporal crop phenology changes in a highly fragmented agricultural landscape;Detecting the long-term spatiotemporal crop phenology changes in a highly fragmented agricultural landscape;"Trends in crop phenometrics reveal the influence of climate variability and change on crop growth and development. However, the trends are less clear in fragmented tropical smallholder landscapes, because there is high spatial and temporal variability in crop phenology. Frequent historical and high spatial resolution (=30 m) Earth observations are needed to track changes in crop phenology in fragmented landscapes but are often unavailable. The spatial?temporal gap can be closed by integrating infrequent high spatial resolution Earth observations with low spatial/high temporal resolution observations through data fusion. We fused 30 m resolution Landsat and 250 m resolution MODIS imagery to investigate trends in crop phenology from 2000 to 2020 in a fragmented agricultural landscape of Ethiopia. We used the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) that had recently been modified for application in fragmented agricultural landscapes. We used the non-parametric Mann?Kendall test for crop phenology trend analysis. Crop phenology based on Landsat?MODIS fusion was compared to MODIS-based crop phenology without fusion. We found data fusion yielded a smaller magnitude of changes in the start of season (SOS: -0.2-day-y- 1 ) and end of season (EOS: -0.50- day-y- 1 ) compared to MODIS SOS (-0.5-day-y- 1 ) and EOS (1.38-day-y- 1 ) due to MODIS-related mixing with the surrounding natural vegetation in the fragmented agricultural landscape. EOS showed a faster rate of change compared to SOS over the 21-years. The Landsat and MODIS fusion captured spatial variation in the timing and magnitude of change specific to crops and their growing environment, which has implications for adaptation strategies. Our results highlight the importance of long-term data fusion to improve the spatial dimension of crop phenology time series analysis. Integrating time series land cover maps into the data fusion processing chain could further improve long-term data fusion for crop phenology trend analysis."
132;A multi-year land use trajectory strategy for non-active agricultural land mapping in sub-humid West Africa;"Enzo Castro Alvarado a,* , Agn? B?ua,b , Louise Leroux c,d,e , Raffaele Gaetano a,b";"Non-active agricultural land (NAAL) mapping in West Africa is essential to accurately assess agricultural systems and its contribution to food security and agro-ecological sustainability of current practices, and yet the available mapping methodologies are not adapted to the environmental and cropping conditions encountered when addressing tropical smallholder agriculture. In this study we present a strategy that makes use of Sentinel2 image time series, CHIRPS monthly rainfall data and multiple years of in-situ data obtained from the JECAM database to map NAAL in a Soudanian site in Burkina Faso (Koumbia) between the years 2016 and 2021. In a first step we generated annual land use maps in four broad classes (managed, unmanaged, evergreen and non-vegetated) to detect fields being actively cultivated in a given year, and in a second step, we used these annual land use maps to differentiate non-active agricultural land by identifying shifts from one year to another. For the validation part, we analyzed the sensitivity of classification accuracy to in-situ data pre-processing by building 5 experimental validation data sets. The unmanaged classes F1-scores of the land use maps ranged between 0.86 and 0.98, depending on the year, whereas NAAL classes F1-scores ranged from 0.75 to 0.92 when validated against the most restrictive data set (pixels with no missing reference data for the period considered). NAAL represents between 7% to 14% of the study site cropland depending on the year. The higher class probabilities are in areas where data was available, whereas the low probabilities are localized and linked to transition areas on the outskirts of the department. Our results indicate that a multi-annual approach can allow NAAL mapping under challenging environments, yet efforts are to be made to develop more cost-efficient unsupervised solutions"
133;"The dynamic nexus between economic growth, renewable energy use, urbanization, industrialization, tourism, agricultural productivity, forest area, and carbon dioxide emissions in the Philippines";Asif Raihan;"Global climate change, intensified by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), provides a massive threat to human life, the environment, development, and sustainability. Consequently, reducing emissions and improving environmental conditions are now a global priority for promoting sustainable growth and preventing the adverse consequences of global warming and climate change. However, there is a paucity of research employing econometric methodologies to investigate the potential of emission reduction factors, particularly in the case of the Philippines. Thus, the present study explored the dynamic effects of economic growth, renewable energy use, urbanization, industrialization, tourism, agricultural productivity, and forest area in the Philippines in order to accomplish environmental sustainability by lowering CO2 emissions. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach and the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) methodology were used to scrutinize time series yearly data from 1990 to 2020. According to the estimates, a 1% rise in economic growth, urbanization, industrialization, and tourism will raise CO2 emissions by 0.16%, 1.25%, 0.06%, and 0.02% in the Philippines, respectively. Furthermore, a 1% increase in renewable energy consumption, agricultural productivity, and forest area may result in CO2 emissions reductions of 1.50%, 0.20%, and 3.46%, respectively. Furthermore, the pairwise Granger causality test was employed to capture the causal relationships between the variables. This article provides policy implications on low-carbon economies, promoting renewable energy use, sustainable urbanization, green industrialization, eco-friendly tourism, climate-smart agriculture, and sustainable forest management, all of which could help ensure environmental sustainability by lowering emissions."
134;The effect of agricultural subsidies on chemical fertilizer use: Evidence from a new policy in China;"Pengfei Fan a , Ashok K. Mishra b,* , Shuyi Feng a , Min Su a";"This study uses a nationally representative rural household survey from China, the difference-in-difference, three-step approach, and Seemingly Unrelated Regression methods to assess the impacts of China?s new agricultural subsidy on chemical fertilizer use, heterogeneity effect, and mechanism. The results show that, first, the new agriculture subsidy reduces the use of chemical fertilizer by about 7.2 percent. A series of robustness tests confirm the finding. Second, the heterogeneity analysis shows that the subsidy?s negative impact on fertilizer use is substantially greater among younger farmers than among older farmers. The negative effect also is significantly more in the main grain-producing areas than in non-grain-producing regions in China. Third, the mediating effect analysis shows that farmland scale mediates 8.3 percent of fertilizer use, and the adoption of agricultural machinery mediates 48.6 percent of fertilizer use. Our findings underscore the positive role that reforming the agrarian subsidy policy plays in sustainable development."
135;Sediment source determination for a series of connected check dams in an agricultural catchment in the Chinese Mollisol region;"Jiaqiong Zhang a,b,* , Yueting Shang a , Ruru Bai a , Minfeng Yin a , Xiaotong Wang a , Fenli Zheng a,b,";"The composite fingerprinting approach is valuable in sediment source identification at different temporal and spatial scales. However, few studies have estimated watershed sediment source connections and transport impacted by multiple check dams. This is due to the complexity of particle sorting under flood discharge practices. Here, we attempt to identify sediment sources with three connected check dams in an agricultural Mollisol catchment in Northeast China based on optimal fingerprints screened from different size fractions (i.e., <10, <63, and <1000 ?m). The results showed consistent sediment contributions based on fine particle size ranges (i.e., <10 and <63 ?m) but an inconsistent contribution based on a coarse particle size range (i.e., <1000 ?m), regardless of the particle size or the organic corrections applied. Sediment deposited in check dams No. 1 and No. 2 was mainly from hillslopes (cropland) (>66.7 %), while sediment in check dam No. 3 was from its adjacent upstream check dam (i.e., No. 2 >60.5 %) based on optimal fingerprints screened from <10 and <63 ?m particle size ranges. However, when fingerprints were screened from a coarse particle size (<1000 ?m), sediment in all three check dams was mainly from gully slopes (>79.0 %), regardless of the specific surface area (SSA) of particles or the soil organic carbon (SOC) correction factors used in the model except for SOC correction for check dam No. 2. Conversely, sediment was mainly derived from hillslopes when fingerprint values were corrected using SSA and SOC, except that no optimal fingerprints were selected. This indicated the feasibility of sediment source discrimination based on the composite fingerprinting approach for sediment source identification in catchments with a series of connected check dams under the condition that particle fractions impacted by check dams are relatively weak. However, optimal fingerprints screened from a relatively wide range of coarse particles caused divergent results regardless of the particle size or the organic correction factors used in model estimation or in fingerprint values. Further studies are necessary to explore the reliability of the composite fingerprinting approach for sediment source tracing under a series of connected check dams, where coarse sediment is selectively deposited and fine sediment is massively discharged under flood discharge practices."
136;Challenges and progresses in the detailed estimation of sediment export in agricultural watersheds in Navarra (Spain) after two decades of experience;"Inigo ? Barberena a , Eduardo Luquin b , Miguel Angel ? Campo-Bescos? a , Javier Eslava c , Rafael Gim?enez a , Javier Casala,*";"Soil erosion is a very serious environmental problem worldwide, with agriculture considered the main source of sediment in inland waters. In order to determine the extent and importance of soil erosion in the Spanish region of Navarra, in 1995 the Government of Navarra established the Network of Experimental Agricultural Watersheds (NEAWGN), which consists of five small watersheds representative of local conditions. In each watershed, key hydrometeorological variables, including turbidity, were recorded every 10 min, and daily samples were taken to determine suspended sediment concentration. In 2006, the frequency of suspended sediment sampling was increased during hydrologically relevant events. The main objective of this study is to explore the possibility of obtaining long and accurate time series of suspended sediment concentration in the NEAWGN. To this end, simple linear regressions between sediment concentration and turbidity are proposed. In addition, supervised learning models incorporating a larger number of predictive variables are used for the same purpose. A series of indicators are proposed to objectively characterize the intensity and timing of sampling. It was not possible to obtain a satisfactory model for estimating the concentration of suspended sediment. This would be mainly due to the large temporal variability found of the physical and mineralogical characteristics of the sediment, which would be affecting the turbidity value, independently of the sediment concentration, per se. This fact would be particularly important in small river watersheds such as those of this study, and especially if their physical conditions are spatially and temporally radically disturbed by agricultural tillage and by a constant modification of the vegetation cover, as is the case in cereal basins. Our findings suggest that better results could be obtained by including in the analysis variables such as soil texture and exported sediment texture, rainfall erosivity, and the state of vegetation cover and riparian vegetation."
137;Time-frequency volatility connectedness between fossil energy and agricultural commodities: Comparing the COVID-19 pandemic with the Russia-Ukraine conflict;"You Wu a , Wenting Ren a , Jieru Wan b , Xiaoxue Liu a,";"This paper uses the TVP-VAR frequency connectedness approach to compare the volatility connectedness induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Both shocks induce increased connectedness, but the pandemic shock is stronger. High-frequency and medium-frequency connectedness dominate during the early stage of the pandemic, while lowfrequency connectedness dominates during the conflict. Moreover, fossil energy is the risk transmitter in the early phase of the pandemic, while agricultural commodities become the transmitter during the conflict. We should take precautions against risks contagion from fossil energy and agricultural commodities to the post-conflict economy, and prevent inflation and economic slowdown."
138;Solving Agricultural Price Recommendation Problem Using Smart Reading Algorithms;"Fajar Delli Wihartikoa,d, Sri Nurdiatib *, Agus Buonoa , Edi Santosac";"An optimization problem with time series forecasting constraints (OPTSFC) is defined as one with constraints given as prediction results from time series. OPTSFC can be solved in stages using prediction and optimization algorithms. In this study, the OPTSFC problem was solved using a smart reading algorithm (SRA), a strategy that uses various alternative settlement techniques according to the available criteria. The techniques used in the SRA-OPTSFC include descriptive statistics, Regression (Linear), recurrent neural network, and particle swarm optimization. In this study, the OPTSFC model and the SRA-OPTSFC algorithm are implemented in the agricultural price recommendation problem. The results of the implementation show that different criteria produce different optimal solutions. A high prediction accuracy value produces an optimal solution close to the prediction results. This has been proved in the predicted value theorem, as illustrated through research experiments. Furthermore, the experimental results show the importance of the time series changes from low to high categorization accompanied by changes in the accuracy value to 93.6%, indicating a narrowing of the feasible area by 99.65% toward the time series prediction results."
139;"Energy, agriculture, and precious metals: Evidence from time-varying Granger causal relationships for both return and volatility";"Farrukh Shahzad a , Elie Bouri b , Khaled Mokni c,d , Ahdi Noomen Ajmi e,f,*";"The existing literature on the Granger causality between various commodity sector (energy, agriculture, and precious metals) indices remains limited in several aspects such as the long length of the sample period, timevariation in the causality relationship, and the examination of both returns and volatility. In the context of an enduring debate on the dynamic relationships among commodity sector indices during various turbulent and crisis periods, we use a long sample period, from January 1960 to May 2021, and detect changes in the relationships for both returns and volatility series via the application of the recent time-varying Granger causality test of Shi et al. (2020). The results show evidence of significant time changes in the relationships across all pairs of commodity sector indices, for both return and volatility and, in some cases, significant sequential feedback effects that are heterogenous across the three commodity sector indices. The evidence of temporary spillovers between energy and agriculture and energy and precious metals is more frequent than between agricultural and precious metals, especially for the return series. The time-variation and heterogeneity in the Granger causal relationships among the commodity sector indices do not always coincide with stress and crisis periods but can be seen in light of continuous developments and challenges in the commodity markets such as biofuel expansion and the financialization phenomenon"

This system is based on the analysis of remotely sensed time series data of (Agriculture Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectra-radiometer MODIS NDVI ? Rain-Fall Estimate RFE 2.0). Three agriculture projects located in Sudan White Nile sub-basin ??Assalaya Project (AAP)?, Wadi Halfa (WHAP) at Atbara Basin, and Ginude agriculture project at Blue Nile sub-basin are taken for pilot study using this newly developed system which is includes GIS-based procedures for computing water and agriculture spatial indicators. The data used is derived from satellite images product at different spatial and temporal resolution. These products were extracted automatically and stored with their analyses and results in special database, which could be used with easily manner to obtain and compute indicators and perform statistical data analyses. WRASIS has specific tools to analyze and display data in a tabular form, classify maps and display statistical charts as well. WRASIS runs in three main phases data-base preparation, model calculation (data analysis), and finally system tools and outputs. The outputs are either basic indicators (one indicator for one-time step) or advanced indicators. Many satellite images with diverse products and resolutions could be added to the system in data preparing phase for other applications at any area. In the present study and from monitoring and assessments of the three agriculture projects, the effect of supplementary irrigation is clear."
141;"Dynamic impacts of economic growth, energy use, tourism, and agricultural productivity on carbon dioxide emissions in Egypt";"Asif Raihana,* , Said Ibrahimb , Dewan Ahmed Muhtasimc";"Global climate change, exacerbated by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, notably carbon dioxide (CO2), provides a huge danger to lives, the global environment, and development. The current study explored the dynamic effects of economic growth, fossil fuel energy consumption, renewable energy consumption, tourism, and agricultural productivity on CO2 emissions in Egypt. The Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) method was used to analyze time series data from 1990 to 2019. The empirical findings revealed that, while economic growth, the use of fossil fuel energy, and tourism contribute to environmental damage by cumulative CO2 emissions in Egypt, an increased share of renewable energy and agricultural productivity contribute to improved environmental quality by lowering CO2 emissions. Similar results were obtained using alternative estimators such as fully modified least squares (FMOLS) and canonical cointegrating regression (CCR). Furthermore, the pairwise Granger causality test was used to determine the causal relationship between the variables. This study adds to the current literature by putting light on the causes of pollution in Egypt. This article made policy ideas for a low-carbon economy, boosting renewable energy consumption, green tourism, and climate-smart agriculture, all of which would assure environmental sustainability in Egypt by lowering emissions."
142;Do mineral rents endowment and agricultural raw material imports determine natural resource management in the United States?;"Jie Li a,* , Pengfei Cheng a,**, Xingyue Qian b";"The scarcity of natural resources is an issue that affects many countries around the world. Mineral rents and agricultural raw material imports have a large impact on the availability of these resources. Natural resource management is the practice of using natural resources such as water, land, soil, plants, and animals for the benefit of society. This paper examines the impact of mineral rents, and agricultural raw materials imports on natural resource management in the United States from 1975 to 2020, using textile clothing, alternative energy sources, and CO2 emissions as control variables. The results show that textile clothing, mineral rents, alternative nuclear energy, and CO2 emissions are statistically significant at 1%. Textile and clothing production, alternative and nuclear energy, and CO2 emissions are all activities that can hurt natural resources. In contrast, evidence suggests that mineral rents can positively influence natural resource rents. Implementing efficient production processes and technologies is essential for reducing resource use. At the same time, governments must create incentives to encourage using more sustainable resources. This could include tax incentives for companies that use sustainable resources or subsidies for developing more efficient production processes. The best way to address the scarcity of natural resources is through careful management of mineral rents and agricultural raw material imports. Finally, policymakers must ensure that the benefits of the imports outweigh the costs to the environment and natural resources and encourage only sustainable resources to be used, and that production processes are designed to minimize resource use."
143;Reducing the time-dependent climate impact of intensive agriculture with strategically positioned short rotation coppice willow;"David Livingstone a,d,* , Beatrice M. Smyth a,**, Rachel Cassidy b , Simon T. Murray c , Gary A. Lyons d , Aoife M. Foley a,e,f , Christopher R. Johnston d";"In this study the implementation of a short rotation coppice willow system, planted as a riparian buffer in an intensive agricultural setting, to intercept and reduce nutrient losses, was investigated. The aim of the work was to assess how such a system could reduce the overall climate impact of an intensive agricultural setting. A life cycle assessment was carried out for a combined Irish dairy farm and willow buffer system considering the impact category, climate impact. The climate impact was considering using the time-dependent climate impact metric, with the results given in terms of the impact on the global surface temperature. The results were compared to an Irish dairy farm in which no willow was planted. Such a system has not previously been investigated in this way and this was the first time-dependent climate impact assessment of a willow plantation planted on pastureland. Geographic information systems software, was used to map areas particularly susceptible to agricultural run-off and suitable for willow planting, using the land bank of the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute research farm in Hillsborough, Northern Ireland, for the case study. The harvested willow was assumed to be combusted in a combined heat and power plant. By implementing the willow system the time-dependent climate impact of an Irish dairy farm could be reduced by 8% with only 3.7% of the land used for willow cultivation over a 101-year study period. The results also found an immediate reduction in climate impact following the implementation of the willow system. Total GHG emissions were reduced by 131 Mg CO2eq ha- 1 over the study timeframe. The results can be more broadly applied to other agricultural sectors, such as arable farming where the climate impact savings of the willow system could be even higher."
144;Structural change in the South African agricultural sector: Bai-Perron modelling;"Etian Ngobeni* , Chiedza L. Muchopa";"There is a consensus that the agricultural sector in developing countries has ascendancy in elevating economic growth through structural change hence continued improvements are imperative, especially in the case of countries such as South Africa with a low agricultural GDP contribution to the economy. Policymakers have to keep a handle on structural change issues. However, the dawdling research on structural change, particularly in the agricultural sector in South Africa, causes a fallback on the sector?s development due to the absence of quality evidence-based policy research. This study analysed structural breaks in the agricultural sector using the value of agricultural production as a variable and then evaluated the effects of economic factors such as employment, exports, government expenditure, and inflation on the value of agricultural production output in the presence of each significant structural break between 1983 and 2020. The Bai-Perron test forecasted two structural break dates (1988 and 1994) in South Africa?s agricultural sector. The model results reveal that agricultural exports positively influenced the value of agricultural production output in the resulting two structural change regimes, while employment in agriculture, government expenditure in agriculture, and inflation positively influenced the value of agricultural production output only in the regime 1994?2020. The recommendation is that policy reforms aimed at boosting agricultural exports should be pursued."

146;Cropland abandonment in a shrinking agricultural landscape: Patch-level measurement of different cropland fragmentation patterns in Central Iran;"Pantea Lotfi a , Mozhgan Ahmadi Nadoushan b,* , Aliasghar Besalatpour c";"Cropland abandonment (CA) is a growing socio-economic and ecological concern worldwide. CA is formed as a gradual and spatiotemporally complex pattern of agricultural land change that affect accurate measurement of its magnitude and determinants. In this study, different spatial metrics including Attrition, Shrinkage, Fragmentation and Porosity are introduced and developed to better investigate CA in a highly water-deficient agricultural landscape (1964.5 km2 ) in Central Iran. Annual cropland layers were successfully produced from 1982 to 2022 using Landsat images and areas with more than 5 consecutive years of fallow in 10-year periods were classified as abandoned croplands. In each period, more than 20% of the relict agricultural land areas experienced CA. Moreover, CA represented a highly uneven spatio-temporal distribution. The majority of abandonment occurred on the periphery of active croplands either along the patch edge (Shrinkage) or deep penetration into crop patches (Fragmentation). The area of Porosity, measured as the abandonment holes inside active croplands, increased with increasing conversion of cropland to built-up areas. The complete abandonment of cropland patches (Attrition) was more dominant in resource deficit downstream parts, exhibiting the final stage of the transition from temporal to permanent CA. Results showed that the classification of CA by their spatial configura"

Accurate identification of agricultural drought is a crucial task to mitigate its consequences. However, it is challenging to achieve reliable and accurate regional agricultural drought assessment in both wet and dry climates at the same time. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify a reliable and accurate agricultural drought index that performs well in both dry and wet climates. Drought indices such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), the Soil Moisture Anomaly index (SMA), and the Drought Severity Index (DSI) were calculated and compared against in situ drought information devised by official sources in China. The results showed that: (1) DSI based on the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) products performed the best in identifying agricultural drought in both dry and wet climate regions of China. (2) Agricultural regions such as Northern arid and semiarid regions, Northeast China Plain, Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, and Loess Plateau, experienced moderate and severe agricultural droughts with a frequency of 20%. (3) The frequency of agricultural droughts observed in Northern arid and semi-arid regions and Northeast China Plain has slowed significantly over the last two decades with a significance level of 0.01. On the other hand, the number of agricultural droughts has increased in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau since 2002."
148;"Conflict vs sustainability of global energy, agricultural and metal markets: A lesson from Ukraine-Russia war";"Muhammad Zubair Chishti a,b,* , Ali Awais Khalid c , Moniba Sana d";"This article endeavors to reveal the asymmetric effects of the Ukraine-Russia War (URW) on various markets, including energy, metals, and agriculture. To do so, the study deploys the cross-quantilogram technique while utilizing the daily data from February 22, 2022, to October 21, 2022. The results for metal commodities determine that, owing to the war, the aluminum, copper, and gold markets have to face significant losses across the various quantiles, except for silver, which demonstrates a mixed response. Meanwhile, the case of energy commodities discloses that war markedly deteriorates the crude and Brent oil markets throughout the different quantiles. However, the gas market gains significant benefits during the URW. In the case of agricultural markets, all the commodities are crippled with significant losses throughout the entire quantile spectrum due to the war. In addition, the novel rolling window multiple correlation (RWMC) technique supports the main findings by affirming the significant effects of URW across the various time horizons. The findings of this study may assist policymakers in reducing geopolitical risks through attempts to end war and suggest the diversification of energy and agricultural commodities to reduce the reliance on specific countries for trading."
149;Energy productivity and GHG emission in the european agriculture: The club convergence approach;"Tomas Bale?zentis * , Mindaugas Butkus, Dalia Streimikien ? e";"The agricultural production plays an important role in food provision and income generation for the rural population. To mitigate the climate change and ensure food security, the agricultural sector has faced multiple initiatives, including the European Green Deal. Developing effective frameworks for measures under such initiatives requires identifying reasonable benchmarks. Accordingly, it is important to assess the patterns of input use and productivity in the agricultural sector. This paper focuses on the agricultural energy productivity in the European Union (EU) Member States during 2005?2019. Indeed, the EU allocates substantial support to improve resource efficiency and reduce climate pressures in the agriculture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to apply the club convergence approach for the energy productivity the EU agriculture. This particular approach allows identifying the homogenous groups of the EU countries and, subsequently, assess the dynamics of the agricultural energy productivity within these groups. The results indicate that the agricultural energy productivity still requires attention in the EU countries, as only partial convergence was observed during 2015?2019. The EU countries were grouped into five clusters with different levels of the agricultural energy productivity. The results imply that the differences among resulting clusters remained rather stable over time. Therefore, relevant policies addressing energy efficiency issues can be developed for these relatively homogeneous groups to ensure further cohesion. The results suggest that countries with high energy productivity may show high levels of greenhouse gas intensity (and low levels of, e.g., labour productivity). Therefore, energy conservation and introduction of clean energy is a complex task that can be guided by the proposed framework and adjustment in the Common Agricultural Policy measures."
150;"Alarming contagion effects: The dangerous ripple effect of extreme price spillovers across crude oil, carbon emission allowance, and agriculture futures markets";"Yu Wei a , Yizhi Wang b,* , Samuel A. Vigne c , Zhenyu Ma d";"The inherent financial interconnections between crude oil prices, carbon emission allowances, and agriculture commodity futures warrant a thorough investigation as fossil energy consumption, carbon emissions, and agriculture plants are three critical components of global environmental protection. This paper aims to quantify not only the normal (mean quantile) static and dynamic spillover effects among them in both time and frequency domains but also the more critical extreme spillovers that occur across various time horizons. Additionally, we explore the vital role of carbon futures in hedging risk and enhancing the performance of oil and agricultural portfolios. Empirical results indicate that, under extreme market situations, the total spillovers among oil, carbon, and agriculture commodity futures are much larger than those under normal conditions. Furthermore, soybean and corn are generally the most potent information transmitters over other futures in the time domain, while carbon emission allowance futures act as an obvious spillover receiver at both normal and extreme market conditions across various time frequencies. Both the total spillover and the net spillover are centered at a short-term frequency (i.e., one to four weeks). Finally, we find that carbon futures can contribute to improving the hedge effectiveness and performance of oil and agricultural portfolios. These findings have valuable implications for policymakers, relevant producers/consumers, as well as futures investors."
151;ChatAgri: Exploring potentials of ChatGPT on cross-linguistic agricultural text classification;"Biao Zhao a,1 , Weiqiang Jin a,1 , Javier Del Ser b , Guang Yang c,d,e,";"In the era of sustainable smart agriculture, a vast amount of agricultural news text is posted online, accumulating significant agricultural knowledge. To efficiently access this knowledge, effective text classification techniques are urgently needed. Deep learning approaches, such as fine-tuning strategies on pre-trained language models (PLMs), have shown remarkable performance gains. Nonetheless, these methods face several complex challenges, including limited agricultural training data, poor domain transferability (especially across languages), and complex and expensive deployment of large models. Inspired by the success of recent ChatGPT models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4), this work explores the potential of applying ChatGPT in the field of agricultural informatization. Various crucial factors, such as prompt construction, answer parsing, and different ChatGPT variants, are thoroughly investigated to maximize its capabilities. A preliminary comparative study is conducted, comparing ChatGPT with PLMs-based fine-tuning methods and PLMs-based prompt-tuning methods. Empirical results demonstrate that ChatGPT effectively addresses the mentioned research challenges and bottlenecks, making it an ideal solution for agricultural text classification. Moreover, ChatGPT achieves comparable performance to existing PLM-based fine-tuning methods, even without fine-tuning on agricultural data samples. We hope this preliminary study could inspire the emergence of a general-purpose AI paradigm for agricultural text processing."
152;Sustainable fertilisation management via tensor multi-task learning using multi-dimensional agricultural data;"Yu Zhang a , Xulong Wang a , Tong Liu a , Rujing Wang b , Yang Li c , Qing Xue c , Po Yang a,*";"Precision fertilisation is crucial to agricultural system, which enables to balance soil nutrients, save fertiliser, reduce emissions, and increase crop yield productivity. Due to the low-level sensor and network technologies on most farms, it is difficult to acquire diverse and comprehensive agricultural data. Hence, the absence of agricultural data becomes a major obstacle to the applications of machine learning techniques in precision fertilisation. In this work, we investigate a newly acquired real-world agricultural dataset collected from four genuine winter wheat farms in the United Kingdom, which covers various sorts of agricultural information, such as climate, soil nutrients, and crop yield. To deal with the spatio-temporal characteristics of the agricultural dataset, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) approach that utilises a tensor created from original data to efficiently predict the amount and timing of base fertiliser and topdressing. Specifically, the agricultural measurements (such as climatic data, soil nutrients, etc.) are encoded into a three-dimensional tensor, and tensor decomposition is utilised to extract a series of interpretable temporal and spatial latent factors from the raw data. The latent factor is then utilised as a multi-task relationship to train the spatio-temporal tensor prediction model. The temporal latent factor can be regarded as a temporal pattern shared by different farms on the fertilisation operation of the same crop, and the spatial latent factor can be regarded as the influence of different farm locations on the fertilisation operation of the same crop. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate our proposed method utilising the real-world agricultural dataset, in comparison to the standard regression models. Results show that our proposed method provide superior accuracy and stability in fertilisation prediction. Moreover, we have constructed a precision fertilisation system that integrates the proposed algorithm and multidimensional agricultural data to assist farms in achieving intelligent, precise and personalised farm management and fertilisation decisions."
153;Role of environmental degradation and energy use for agricultural economic growth: Sustainable implications based on ARDL estimation;Hongwei Wang;"The purpose of this study is to explain factors driving the agricultural economic growth (AEG) in China by evaluating effects of oil consumption (OILC), electricity consumption (ELC), gas consumption (GASC), CO2 emission, and agricultural export (AGExp) on AEG of China. The time series data of 35 years for China has been collected over the time from 1985 to 2019. On time series data, ??auto regressive distributed lag?? (ARDL) modeling has been performed to assess short-term and long-term relationships of determinants of AEG with agricultural economic growth. Results of this study have revealed that CO2 emissions, AGExp, OILC, and GASC have significant effects on AEG in China in long run but ELC does not have any significant effects on AEG in China in long run. Results of short-term effects revealed that OILC and GASC have significant effects on AEG in China in short run but ELC, CO2, and AGExp do not have any significant effects on AEG in China in short run. The current research draws useful implications for policymakers of China by recommending them how they can enhance AEG and boost their agricultural sector by encouraging energy consumptions and export of agricultural products in the sector. Existing literature demonstrates the lack of empirical evidence, harmonized results, and sufficient insights about OILC-AEG, ELC-AEG, and GASC-AEG nexus so, this paper shortens this gap in the literature by explaining these factors of AEG of China the first time through ARDL modeling."

A systematic literature review (SLR) method was used to conduct the review research. A total number of 61 articles on DI in agriculture were reviewed. The PRISMA flowchart completed the overall process to confirm the final selection of the review. The review outcomes provided that most DI in agriculture research was based on food supply, technology adoption, digital risk management, and agriculture modernization from the evidence of some selected developed and developing countries. Only a few DI research were found from the evidence of transition economies. However, the review found a lack of research on the government?s inclusion of DI in agriculture. More investigations are required for the sub-sector of the agriculture industry for the actual development of the overall agriculture industry. So far, the researchers? knowledge the review is possibly the very first attempt by any researchers to work on SLR research regarding DI in agriculture. This paper contributes to agriculture, a vital process in the marketplace that currently lacks a strong foundation of innovation theory in this sector.

The Mann-Kendall trend test was adopted to examine the trends of the monitoring data of climatic-anthropogenic factors and groundwater depth-salinity, as well as the modeling and remote-sensing results of natural vegetation growth. Results indicated significant decreasing net water diversion while increasing drainage since agricultural water saving, which is a major cause of groundwater reduction instead of climatic factors. This reduction was further confirmed with significant increasing groundwater depth (GWD) trends found in about 90 out of the total 224 monitoring wells across Hetao during 1970?2015. An overall salt accumulation was recognized for Hetao, but groundwater salinity only significantly changed in a few areas with insignificant trends found for more than 70 out of the total 114 monitoring wells during 1995?2015. Meanwhile, significant large-scale decreasing trends were detected for both simulated natural vegetation biomass and remote-sensing derived vegetation index, and wetland loss problem was also found. Particularly, relatively strong similarities were found among the spatial distributions of significant increasing GWD, decreasing vegetation biomass and index, and losing wetlands. This further suggested that the reduction might have caused negative ecological impacts. Overall, the results provided important information regarding long-term regional groundwater responses and their ecological impacts under agricultural water saving, which is significant for agricultural water management for arid irrigation districts."

Farzan a";Burning of agricultural fields is an understudied source of air pollution in rural communities in the United States. Smoke from agricultural burning contains air toxics that adversely impact respiratory health. Imperial County in southeastern California is a highly productive agricultural valley that heavily employs agricultural burning to clear post-harvest crop remnants. We related individual-level exposure to agricultural burns to parent-reported respiratory symptoms in children. We leveraged the Childrens Assessing Imperial Valley Respiratory Health and the Environment (AIRE) cohort of 735 predominantly Hispanic low-income elementary school students in Imperial County. Parents reported childrens respiratory health symptoms and family demographic characteristics in questionnaires collected at enrollment and in annual follow-up assessments from 2017 to 2019. Permitted agricultural burns in Imperial County from 2016 to 2019 were spatially linked to childrens geocoded residential addresses. We used generalized estimating equations to evaluate prevalence differences (PDs) in respiratory symptoms with increasing exposure to agricultural burning within 3 km in the 12 months prior to each assessment.

In this study, 129 papers that are based on DL applications used in agriculture are discussed, categorizing them into five areas: crop yield prediction, plant stress detection, weed and pest detection, disease detection, and smart farming. Smart farming is sub-categorized as water management, seed analysis, and soil analysis. This study highlights the potential of deep learning in enhancing agricultural productivity and promoting economic growth. The study found that supervised learning networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), AlexNet, and ResNet, are primarily used in agriculture to enhance economic growth. However, there is a need to develop new DL techniques that can improve model performance and reduce inference time for practical applications. In this review, critical research gaps, particularly in the development of new techniques, are analyzed. This study emphasizes the importance of continued research in this area to fully leverage DL?s potential of DL for smart farming and to achieve sustainable agricultural development."

Larsen a,? , Amy Quandt b , Iris Foxfoot a , Nicol Parker a , Daniel Sousa b";"Agricultural land retirement generates risks and opportunities for ecological communities and ecosystem services. Of particular interest is the influence of retired cropland on agricultural pests and pesticides, as these uncultivated lands may directly shift the distribution of pesticide use and may serve as a source of pests and/or natural enemies for remaining active croplands. Few studies have investigated how agricultural pesticide use is impacted by land retirement. Here we couple field-level crop and pesticide data from over 200,000 field-year observations and 15 years of production in Kern County, CA, USA to investigate: 1) how much pesticide use and applied toxicity are avoided annually due to the direct effects of retirement, 2) whether surrounding retirement drives pesticide use on active cropland and what types of pesticides are most influenced, and 3) whether the effect of surrounding retirement on pesticide use is dependent on the age or revegetation cover on retired parcels. Our results suggest about 100 kha are idle in any given year, which equates to about 1.3-3 M kg of pesticide active ingredients foregone. We also find retired lands lead to a small increase in total pesticide use on nearby active lands even after controlling for a combination of crop-, farmer-, regionand year-specific heterogeneity. More specifically, the results suggest a 10 % increase in retired lands nearby results in about a 0.6 % increase in pesticides, with the effect sizes increasing as a function of the duration of continuous fallowing, but decreasing or even reversing sign at high levels of revegetation cover. Our results suggest increasingly prevalent agricultural land retirement can shift the distribution of pesticides based on what crops are retired and what active crops remain nearby"
162;The performance of SPEI integrated remote sensing data for monitoring agricultural drought in the North China Plain;"Haigen Zhao a,* , Yingchun Huang b , Xiaowei Wang a , Xiaoyu Li a , Tianjie Lei a,*";"Agricultural drought is significantly affecting sustainable crop production. One of climate-based drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) calculated by the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET), is being more and more widely employed to characterize the spatio-temporal pattern of agricultural drought. However, substantial uncertainties exist in the current PET methods due to unrealistic configurations of the heterogeneity of crop surface characteristics or complicated parameterization scheme. In this study, standard Penman?Monteith (PM) model is modified and derived by meteorological factors and leaf area index (LAI) and albedo data based on remote sensing. Then, the modified SPEI was calculated by the monthly difference between precipitation and PM model integrated remote sensing data (referred as PMRS) over the North China Plain (NCP) between 1982 and 2016. Comparing with the FAO56 reference evapotranspiration (referred as PMRC) and a simplified version of standard PM over open-water surface (referred as PMOW), this study examines how well the PMRS-SPEI captures drought evolution and impacts on crop growth and yield over the NCP in order to evaluate its performance in agricultural drought monitoring. The comparison of SPEIs based on three evapotranspiration equations with soil water moisture in root depth shows that a 6-month lag can be used as the optimum time scale over the NCP. Additionally, the correlation of PMRSSPEI performs better than PMRC-SPEI and PMOW-SPEI. For typical drought events, PMRS-SPEI6 shows remarkable smaller (larger) severe drought values between April and June (August and October) and a shorter (longer) recovery period in the growing season for wheat (maize). Comparing to PMRC-SPEI6 and PMOW-SPEI6, the PMRSSPEI6 shows better performance when examining the Vegetation Health Index and Composite Index of Crop Yield Reduction. Additionally, climate-induced crop yield correlates with PMRS-SPEI6 better than PMOW-SPEI6 and PMRC-SPEI6, particularly in the emergence and filling stages for winter wheat, and silking stage for summer maize. These results demonstrate that integrating remotely sensed data can enhance the agricultural drought monitoring accuracy of SPEI."
163;Productive use of natural resources in agriculture: The main policy lessons;"Ting Feng, Ruoyu Xiong, Peng Huan";"Managing natural resources involves the sustainable use of land, water, air, minerals, forests, fisheries, and wildlife. These ecosystem services improve human life. Natural resources are fundamental to life despite their use for consumption and public goods. Environmental processes increase soil productivity, recycle nutrients, clean air and water, and regulate climate. This paper explores the impacts of agriculture productivity and alternative energy sources on natural resources, considering the roles of imports of goods and services and economic growth in China from 1980 to 2018. Results show that the agriculture productivity index and alternative energy sources decrease natural resource depletion, while economic growth and imports of goods and services increase it. The long-term use of natural resources must be maintained while minimizing their environmental impact and maximizing their social value. By planning or managing the world?s natural resources, we can ensure their integrity for present and future generations, including air, water, land, flora, and fauna. Policymakers must ensure that the earth?s capacity for producing renewable resources is maintained and improved wherever possible. Study limitations and future research directions are mentioned."
164;Monitoring autumn agriculture activities using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and coherence change detection;"Laura Dingle Robertson a,1,* , Heather McNairn a , Marco van der Kooij b , Xianfeng Jiao a , Samuel Ihuoma a , Pamela Joosse c";"Across Canada, farmers are encouraged to adopt beneficial management practices (BMPs) to protect soil heath, reduce green house gas emissions and mitigate off-site impacts from agriculture. Measuring the uptake of BMPs, including the implementation of conservation tillage, helps gauge the success of policies and programs to promote adoption. Satellites are one way to monitor BMP adoption and Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs) are of particular interest given their allweather data collection capability. This research investigated coherent change detection (CCD) to determine when farmers harvest and till their fields. A time series of both Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) images was acquired over a site in the Canadian Lake Erie basin, during the autumn of 2021, when farmers were harvesting and tilling fields of corn, soybeans and wheat. 16 CCD pairs were created and coherence values were interpreted based on observations collected for 101 fields. An m-chi decomposition was applied to the RCM data, and the Volume/Surface (V/S) ratio was calculated as an additional source of information to interpret results. Change events due to harvest, tillage, autumn seeding and chemical termination resulted in coherence values below 0.20. The mean and standard deviation for fields with observed change was 0.18 ? 0.03. Coherence values were 0.42 ? 0.15 for fields where no change was noted. Tests confirmed that the coherence associated with changed and unchanged fields was significantly different. Coherence values could also differentiate between some types of management events, including tillage and harvest. CCD could also separate harvest as a function of crop type (corn or soybeans). V/S ratios declined after tillage events but increased after both harvesting and chemical termination. Narrowing the date of harvest and tillage is as important as detecting change. To meet this requirement, Sentinel-1 and RCM CCD products with values below 0.20 (indicating change had occurred), were graphically overlaid. With this approach, the timing of corn harvest was identified as occurring within a 5-day window. The tilling of corn, soybeans and wheat was narrowed to a 4-day window. The results of this research confirmed that CCD can be used to capture change due to autumn agricultural activities, and this technique can also separate change due to harvest and tillage. Finally, this study demonstrated that when data from different SAR missions are combined in a virtual constellation, timing of harvest and tillage can be more precisely defined."

We discuss the recent progress and perspective of the three fundamental components of CAS ? sensing, modeling, and actuation ? and the emerging concept of agricultural digital twins (DTs). We also discuss how scalable CI is becoming a key enabler of smart agriculture. In this review we shed light on the significance of CAS in revolutionizing crop breeding and production by enhancing efficiency, productivity, sustainability, and resilience to changing climate. Finally, we identify underexplored and promising future directions for CAS research and development"
166;Responses of agricultural drought to meteorological drought under different climatic zones and vegetation types;"Peng Sun a,* , Ruilin Liu a , Rui Yao b , Hao Shen a , Yaojin Bian a";"Meteorological drought (MD) is strongly causal linked to agricultural drought (AD), therefore, MD can be used as an appropriate early warning of AD, enhancing human mitigation of AD. However, drought responses of AD to MD have not been well understood. Here we used the nonstationary standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (NSPEI) and the standardized soil moisture index (SSI) to analyze the evolution characteristics of MD and AD. The drought response time (DRT) and response patterns of drought in different climatic zones with different underlying surface conditions (vegetation type, irrigation) were calculated. A high frequency of MD and AD in southeastern China and the Tibetan Plateau was detected. Besides, AD in southeastern China and MD in central and southern China showed a significant increasing trend. Meanwhile, MD and AD are in the same decreasing trend over the Tibetan Plateau. The highest probability of compound droughts can be found in northern China and regions with a semi-humid warm temperate climate. Drought response sensitivity is higher with shorter agriculture drought response time (DRT) in southeastern China and eastern parts of the Tibetan Plateau than in other regions of China. Besides, DRT is short in summer and autumn, and long in winter and spring. Moreover, when compared to DRT in irrigated agricultural areas, DRT in rainfed agricultural areas is longer and more spatially variable. DRT in double- and triple-crop irrigated areas is remarkably shorter than in single-crop irrigated areas, and DRT with higher crop intensity is shorter."
167;Trends of pesticide residues in agricultural products in the Chinese market from 2011 to 2020;"Jiajun Zhou , Yu Yang , Zhi Fang , Jiahao Liang , Yijin Tan , Chanjuan Liao * , Daoxin Gong , Wenyu Liu , Guanxin Liu";"Pesticide residues in market products pose a serious threat to consumers? health. This study aimed to analyze pesticide residues in agricultural products in the Chinese market. According to the data on agricultural products exceeding maximum residue levels (MRLs) obtained by the market supervision administration, 5387 batches of agricultural products (BAPs) in the Chinese market from 2011 to 2020 were extracted. The basic information of the data, time, region, crops and pesticides were discussed. The characteristics and trends of unqualified pesticide residues (UQPRs) in the Chinese market were statistically analyzed. The results showed that the BAPs withUQPRs increased over time, mainly occurring in spring and autumn. Most of the crops with UQPRs were leafy crops, among which Leek and Celery accounted for 28.3% and 16.9% of the total, respectively. Meanwhile, the regions with the most BAPs were Shandong, Henan, and Chongqing. Combining the statistical results and analyzing the reasons, the occurrence of UQPRs can be reduced from three aspects: government, market, and farmers."
168;Conservation agriculture assists smallholder farmers and their agroecosystem in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;"Willy Mulimbi a,*,1 , Kristofor R. Brye b,2 , Lawton L. Nalley a , Damas R. Birindwa c,3";"Conservation agriculture, a sustainable farming practice combining no or minimum soil disturbance, crop diversification, and soil cover, can benefit humans and the biophysical environment. However, less than half of Sub-Saharan African countries implement conservation agriculture, and the majority of smallholder farmers are using unsustainable practices. Research and field trials on conservation agriculture adaptation to soil and agroecological conditions are vital for increasing adoption of conservation agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the change in soil chemical properties and soil biology from implementation of conservation agriculture, (ii) assess cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) yield and variability under conservation agriculture compared to the conventional farming practice, and (iii) evaluate differences in soil chemical properties, soil biology, and crop yields under conservation agriculture in savannah and forest ecosystems compared to conventional agriculture in smallholder farming in the province of Maniema in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Soils under conservation agriculture had 6.5 times more (p < 0.001) earthworms, 23% and 10% greater (p < 0.05) concentrations of soil phosphorus and potassium, respectively, and 100% greater (p < 0.001) cowpea yield than soils under conventional agriculture. Measured across all sites, conservation agriculture and conventional cowpea yields had coefficients of variation of 25% and 16%, respectively. This study showed for the first time that conservation agriculture implementation contributes to soil health and food security associated with smallholder farming in the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
169;Exploring Climate-Driven agricultural water shortages in a Snow-Fed basin using a water allocation model and Machine learning;"Gabrielle F.S. Boisram?e * , Rosemary W.H. Carroll";"Water allocation models (WAM) can capture complex feedbacks between water infrastructure, water supply, water demand, and water rights structure. They are an important tool for water managers to reduce conflict and aid in future water resource planning. Future streamflow reductions and shifts in timing are anticipated in snowdominated watersheds of the western United States due to projected reductions in snow water storage. These basins tend to be water-limited and rely on groundwater to support agricultural demand. Water managers in the snow-fed, agricultural Walker River Basin (WRB) in California and Nevada use a dynamically coupled WAM and physically based groundwater flow model as a decision support tool. Large computation time is required to simulate groundwater dynamics, limiting the number of model scenarios that can feasibly be run to test alternative management scenarios under climate change. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been used to capture complex nonlinear hydrologic dynamics in other contexts, but to our knowledge there have not been efforts to use ML to increase computational efficiency in modeling groundwater responses to agricultural water use. We use extreme gradient boosting to replace the groundwater sub-model for the WRB decision support tool, resulting in accurate estimates of reservoir storage (monthly error almost always < 5% of reservoir capacity), streamflow (total outflow errors from - 3% to 20% depending on scenario) and agricultural water shortages (-12% to 18% error in total shortage depending on scenario). For comparison, we found that omitting groundwater modeling from the WAM results in a larger overprediction of outflows (2 to 58%) and underprediction in agricultural water shortages (0 to 41%) across a range of scenarios. We use this validated ML method to explore the sensitivity of agricultural water availability to a range of streamflow volumes and streamflow timings. Results indicate that agricultural water shortages are more sensitive to annual streamflow volume in comparison to shifts in streamflow timing. Our model shows that reservoirs can buffer the impact of altered flow timing on agricultural production, except under extreme conditions in which all precipitation falls as rain (no snow storage) and streamflow peaks in the winter. Future work will explore these thresholds in more detail. While the results here are site-specific, the methodology for coupling a WAM with a ML representation of surface?groundwater interactions can be applied to a wide variety of water resource modeling applications. These results also provide a stark example of the importance of snowpack storage and groundwater management to western US water infrastructure."
170;"Nexus between economic growth, energy use, urbanization, agricultural productivity, and carbon dioxide emissions: New insights from Bangladesh";"Asif Raihana,* , Dewan Ahmed Muhtasimb , Sadia Farhanac , Md Ahsan Ul Hasanc , Monirul Islam Pavel b , Omar Faruk b , Mostafizur Rahmand , Abir Mahmoodd";"Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, notably carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are causing global climate change, which poses enormous hazards to human life, the environment, development, and sustainability. Bangladesh is predominantly an agricultural country experiencing continuous economic growth and rapid urbanization which is causing higher energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The present study empirically explores the nexus between economic growth, energy use, urbanization, agricultural productivity, and CO2 emissions in Bangladesh. Time series data from 1972 to 2018 were utilized by employing the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) approach. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds test revealed evidence of cointegration among the variables in the long run which has been verified by the Johansen cointegration test and Engle-Granger cointegration test. The empirical findings reveal that economic growth, energy use, urbanization, and reduced agricultural productivity increase CO2 emissions in Bangladesh. The estimated results are robust to alternative estimators such as fully modified least squares (FMOLS), and canonical cointegrating regression (CCR). In addition, the pairwise Granger causality test is utilized to capture the causal linkage between the variables. This study adds to the current body of knowledge by shining light on the factors that contribute to environmental degradation in Bangladesh. This article put forward policy recommendations aimed at sustainable development by establishing strong regulatory policy instruments to reduce environmental degradation."
171;Quantification of unreported water use for supplemental crop irrigation in humid climates using publicly available agricultural data;"Laljeet Sangha * , Julie Shortridge";"Irrigation accounts for the largest consumptive water use in the United States (US), representing 62% of the total water consumption. Water supply managers and government agencies use user-reported water withdrawal data for developing water management programs. However, many users underreport or are not in compliance with the water withdrawal reporting regulations of the state. The regulations in many states also exempt users from reporting irrigation water withdrawals under a specific amount. Such irregularities in non-reported but consumptive agricultural withdrawals result in the underestimation of water use and considerable uncertainty about the impacts of irrigation withdrawals on water supply. Therefore, this study presents a methodology for estimation of non-reported agricultural withdrawals at the county level to understand their potential effects on water supply and enhance management of agricultural water resources. This study developed a data-based method using USDA census irrigation data, USDA Irrigation and Water Management Survey (IWMS) and gridded meteorological data to develop estimates of irrigation water withdrawals from 2002 to 2017. Additionally, user reported withdrawal data was used to validate estimates and quantify the volume of unreported water use for small (below the withdrawal reporting threshold) and large farms at county level. It was observed that small and large farm unreported withdrawals averaged 13% and 110% of reported withdrawals respectively. Notably, 86% of counties in Virginia with irrigation have collective small farm withdrawals of sufficient magnitude that would be subject to reporting requirements if they were from a single user. Small farm unreported withdrawals were consistent through time and large farm unreported withdrawals decreased between 2002 and 2017 due to lower irrigation demand and higher reporting. This approach provides a practical method that can be adopted by water supply managers to better account for agricultural water use in humid climates where supplemental irrigation is not fully captured in existing permitting and reporting regulations."
172;Multifunctional agriculture in a peri-urban fringe: Chinese farmers? responses to shifts in policy and changing socio-economic conditions;"Bingjie Song a , Guy M. Robinson a,b,* , Douglas K. Bardsley a , Yanlong Xue c , Bing Wang d";"Recent Five-Year Plans and No. 1 Central Documents have emphasised the need for Chinese agriculture to play multiple functions to enhance rural development, alleviate rural poverty and increase agricultural productivity. The concept of Chinese agriculture as multifunctional is explored, linking it to specific policy aims, with three key historical phases of the development of multifunctional agriculture (MFA) recognised. MFA has progressed rapidly in rural-urban fringes across China, and its recent evolution is investigated herewith within two casestudy districts (Baqiao and Lintong) in the megacity of Xi?an, Shaanxi Province. Since the economic reforms of the late 1970s, farmers in the area have greatly increased horticultural production to supply the substantial local urban market, displacing traditional grain cultivation, although much high-quality farmland has been lost to urban development, especially in Baqiao. The city has also supplied tourists for farm-based tourism activities (nong jia le), including pick-your-own fruit. A questionnaire survey of sample farm households in 17 villages in the two districts generated detailed information on land management, including farm-based enterprises, participation in co-operatives, marketing, and both recent and future planned changes to farms. Factor analysis of mixed (qualitative and quantitative) data (FAMD) and hierarchical clustering of principal components (HCPC) were used to examine typical characteristics of MFA in the peri-urban fringe. This yielded five principal dimensions of farming, with on-farm environmental actions as a key characteristic. There were also three different clusters of farmers, differentiated between commercial horticultural production, contrasting less intensive parttime farmers with farmers in co-operatives and/or producing for ?dragonhead? enterprises. Renewed government support for grain cultivation to increase food availability has led to a minor reversion to cereal production, while multifunctionality has been impacted negatively by the Covid pandemic, with reduced tourist numbers. Loss of revenue from tourism is prompting farmers to search for other income streams via increased agricultural outputs, new marketing outlets, and contributions to a more diversified rural economy involving value-adding to agricultural products."
173;A combined index to characterize agricultural drought in Italy at municipality scale;"Lauro Rossi a,* , Gustavo Naumann a , Simone Gabellani a , Carmelo Cammalleri b";"Study region: Italy and in particular the provinces of Verona and Foggia. Study focus: The assessment of drought impacts at local scale requires adequately detailed spatiotemporal estimates of drought severity. Given the intrinsic uncertainty in drought severity estimates based on a single index, especially at high spatial resolution, the use of combined indices is preferable. However, the disagreement between the single indices needs to be addressed. We propose a methodology to combine the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index and the Soil Moisture Anomalies based on a double-entry matrix. The classification adopted to define five semi-quantitative severity classes is generalized by introducing an objective approach to assign values when the two base indices disagree. The methodology is tuned over two Italian provinces, Verona and Foggia, with focus on agricultural drought at the high spatial detail of single municipalities. New hydrological insights for the region: The methodology is proved to be skillful (Heidke Skill Score of 0.75) in capturing the spatio-temporal evolution of the major agricultural droughts observed in the two case study regions (2012, 2015 and 2017), which are benchmarked using data from drought impact databases. The temporal dynamics modeled by this index align with the timeline of the drought events, suggesting that the index is suitable for near-real time agricultural drought monitoring. The simplicity of the double-entry matrix approach allows for upscaling to the entire country."
174;Detecting abandoned citrus crops using Sentinel-2 time series. A case study in the Comunitat Valenciana region (Spain);"Sergio Morell-Monzo? a,* , Mar?-Teresa Sebasti? a-Frasquet b , Javier Estornell c , Enrique Molto? d";"Agricultural land abandonment (ALA) is becoming a growing phenomenon around the world that needs to be monitored and quantified. A massive abandonment of citrus orchards has been experienced in the last years in the Comunitat Valenciana (CV) region (Spain) driven by different socio-economic factors. Therefore, developing time and cost-efficient methods for monitoring ALA is a priority. Citrus are a perennial crop trees which make orchards have low spectral variation during the year. In the CV region, they are planted in relatively small parcels, thus creating a highly fragmented and heterogeneous landscape. This study proposes a machine learningbased classification framework that uses annual time series of spectral indices extracted from Sentinel-2 images to identify crop status at parcel level. The method is based on features extracted from the reconstructed OSAVI and NDMI time series used to train a Random Forest classifier. Then, a parcel-based classification is performed using the parcel boundaries and the probabilities of belonging to each category for the full pixels inside the boundaries. The research assessed the potential to identify three statuses of crops (non-productive, productive, and abandoned). Results on three different temporal and spatial datasets provided an overall accuracy ranging from 89 to 92 %, demonstrating the importance of multi-temporal data to identify the abandonment of perennial crops. Furthermore, we studied the ability of the model to be spatially and temporally transferred. Limitations to recall the abandoned parcels when using models trained in other areas or time periods are exposed, opening the way to model improvements."
175;"A novel comprehensive agricultural drought index accounting for precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture";"Cuiping Yang a , Changhong Liu b , Yuhui Gu a , Yongqiang Wang a , Xuguang Xing a , Xiaoyi Ma a,*";"Univariate drought indices do not reflect the integrated process through which droughts develop and occur. Therefore, developing a multivariate drought index that accounts for precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture is crucial for comprehensive drought prediction and evaluation. In this study, a comprehensive agricultural drought index (CADI) was developed using a combination of five commonly used binary copulas by considering evapotranspiration factors based on the Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI), which is based on both precipitation and soil moisture, and the drought monitoring capability of CADI was evaluated. The relationship between the CADI and the yield anomalies of winter wheat and summer maize in the rainfed and irrigated croplands of the North China Plain (NCP) was analyzed, and the drought evolution characteristics and trends in rainfed and irrigated croplands were examined. The results indicated that compared with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI), and MSDI, the proposed CADI accurately reflected the integrated process of meteorological and agricultural drought occurrence and evolution. In addition, the strength of the correlation between the CADI and the yield anomalies of winter wheat and summer maize in the rainfed and irrigated croplands of the NCP surpassed that of the SPEI, SSI, and MSDI, thereby confirming the validity and reliability of the proposed CADI for drought monitoring. Over the past four decades, droughts in the rainfed and irrigated croplands of the NCP have demonstrated a decreasing trend, and severe droughts have been concentrated in winter. Overall, the results of this study can be used in agrometeorological drought early warning and agricultural impact assessment and can provide theoretical guidance for drought monitoring in other regions."
176;Have the new round of agricultural land system reform improved farmers? agricultural inputs in China?;"Maogang Gong a,b,* , Yanan Zhong a , Yun Zhang a , Ehsan Elahi a,**, Yuanxi Yang c";"China?s modern socialist system completed the registration and certification of farmland ownership and continued to deepen the separation of powers reform at the end of 2020. This facilitated the transfer of land management rights and impacted investment in agricultural production. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the new round of agricultural land system reform on farmers? farm inputs in China?s socialist system. The study uses data from the China Labor-force Dynamic Survey (CLDS) and employs various econometric approaches, including the Propensity Score Matching-Difference in Differences (PSM-DID) method to approach the objectives of the study. The results indicate that the new round of agricultural land system reform significantly promotes the increase of farmers? inputs in agriculture, including the area of land transferred in and self-owned, income from agriculture, number of agricultural labors, and specialized agricultural production. The study suggests that the reform enhances the positive impact of land transferred-in on farmers? farm inputs. The impact of agricultural land confirmation and three rights separation is positive in eastern, central, and western China. The findings suggest that public authorities should continue to improve the efficiency of land allocation and large-scale operation, cultivate new agricultural operation bodies, and improve the level of agricultural production specialization."
177;LEM+ dataset: For agricultural remote sensing applications;"Lucas Volochen Oldoni* , Ieda Del?Arco Sanches, Michelle Cristina A. Picoli, Renan Moreira Covre, JosGuilherme Fronza";"Remote sensing allows obtaining information on agriculture regularly with non-invasive measurement approaches. Field data is crucial for adequate agricultural monitoring by remote sensing. However, public available field data are scarce, mainly in tropical regions, where agriculture is highly dynamic. The present publication aims to support the reduction of this gap. The LEM+ dataset provides information monthly about 16 land use classes for 1854 fields from October 2019 to September 2020 (one Brazilian agricultural year) from Lu? Eduardo Magalh?s (LEM) and other municipalities in the west of Bahia state, Brazil. The reference data were collected in two fieldworks (March 2020 ? first crop season, and August 2020 ? second crop season). The boundaries of the fields visited in situ were delimited using Sentinel-2 false color compositions (near infrared - red - green) at 10 m spatial resolution. The land use classes were labeled monthly based on information collected in situ (agricultural land use and photographs) and by visual interpretation of Sentinel-2 false color composition (near infrared - shortwave infrared - red) and MODIS/Terra (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series. The dataset can be useful for the development of new pattern recognition methods for agricultural land use mapping and monitoring, comparison of different classification methods, and optical and SAR remote sensing time series analysis. This dataset contributes to complement previous initiatives [1,2] to make tropical agriculture field reference data publicly available."
178;Advancing urban planning in arid agricultural-urbanized landscapes of Iran: Spatial modeling evidence from a rapidly developing region;Mozhgan Ahmadi Nadoushan 1;"Binary agricultural-urbanized landscapes in the central arid zone of Iran are under the imminent threat of fragmentation and low crop yields due to uncontrolled low-density urban expansion. To characterize the current process in a case study area in Central Isfahan (1550 km2 ), two scenarios of Business As Usual (BAU) and Agricultural Land Protection (ALP) were simulated using the SLEUTH model and compared statistically to provide relevant urban planning insights. A time-series (1992- 2022) Landsat NDVI-based procedure was developed to characterize the annual cropping intensity of land parcels as a surrogate for agricultural land suitability, showing that only 16.7% of the region (303 parcels with a mean cropping NDVI of 0.184) has a high agricultural suitability. Landsat-derived urban areas also showed a significant road-influenced outlying pattern during the study period, especially in high cropping intensity areas with the SLEUTH Breed and Road Gravity scores of 100 and 60, respectively. By reducing these scores to half, the ALP scenario was developed and together with the BAU was projected up to the year 2045. Results showed significant restrictive growth of new roadinfluenced urban patches under the APL scenario which also targeted least-suitable agricultural areas, especially in high cropping intensity parcels (z= -6.657, p=0.000, sig= 0.05, 2-tailed)"
179;Dependence and risk management of portfolios of metals and agricultural commodity futures;"Waqas Hanif a,b , Walid Mensi c,d , Xuan Vinh Vo e , Ahmed BenSaa f,g , Jose Arreola Hernandez 1 , Sang Hoon Kang h,*";"This paper examines the dependence structure and the portfolio allocation characteristics of a main industrial portfolio metals (gold, platinum, palladium, aluminum, silver, copper, zinc, lead, and nickel), and of an agricultural commodities portfolio (wheat, corn, soybeans, coffee, sugar cane, sugar beets, cocoa, cotton, and lumber). Our methodology is based on regular vine copulas and the conditional Value-at-Risk. The motivation to investigate the dependence structure and connectedness between agricultural, and metal commodities is to identify ways in which agricultural and metal commodities can hedge each other and to explore the possibilities of parallel investments. The results indicate that the dependence dynamics of the main metals portfolio are characterized by symmetric features. However, the dependence dynamics of the agricultural commodities portfolio are characterized by symmetric and asymmetric features symmetric dynamics are predominant. Finally, the metal commodities portfolio is observed to be less risky for financial resource allocation during the global financial crisis."
180;Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence as a vegetation index for agriculture;"Arturo Villarroya-Carpio a , Juan M. Lopez-Sanchez a,* , Marcus E. Engdahl b";"In this study, the use of Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence data as a tool for crop monitoring has been explored. For this purpose, time series of images acquired by Sentinel-1 and 2 spanning 2017 have been analysed. The study site is an agricultural area in Sevilla, Spain, where 16 different crop species were cultivated during that year. The time series of 6-day repeat-pass coherence measured at each polarimetric channel (VV and VH), as well as their difference, have been compared to the NDVI and to the backscattering ratio (VH/VV) and other indices based on backscatter. The contribution of different decorrelation sources and the effect of the bias from the space-averaged sample coherence magnitude estimation have been evaluated. Likewise, the usage of 12 days as temporal baseline was tested. The study has been carried for three different orbits, characterised by different incidence angles and acquisition times. All results support using coherence as a measure for monitoring the crop growing season, as it shows good correlations with the NDVI (??2 > 0.7), and its temporal evolution fits well the main phenological stages of the crops. Although each crop shows its own evolution, the performance of coherence as a vegetation index is high for most of them. VV is generally more correlated with the NDVI than VH. For crop types characterised by low plant density, this difference decreases, with VH even showing higher correlation values in some cases. For a few crop types, such as rice, the backscattering ratio outperforms the coherence in following the growth stages of the plants. Since both coherence and backscattering are directly computed from the radar images, they could be used as complementary sources of information for this purpose. Notably, the measured coherence performs well without the need of compensating the thermal noise decorrelation or the bias due to the finite equivalent number of looks."
181;A review of three-dimensional vision techniques in food and agriculture applications;"Lirong Xiang a,b , Dongyi Wang c,d,*";"In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) machine vision techniques have been widely employed in agriculture and food systems, leveraging advanced deep learning technologies. However, with the rapid development of threedimensional (3D) imaging techniques, the lack of a systematic review has hindered our ability to identify the most suitable imaging systems for specific agricultural and food applications. In this review, a variety of 3D imaging techniques are introduced, with their working principles and applications in agriculture and food systems. These techniques include Structure lighting-based 3D imaging, Multiview 3D imaging system, Time of Flight (ToF)-based 3D imaging system, Lighting Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and Depth estimation from monocular image. Furthermore, the three-dimensional image analysis methods applied to these 3D imaging techniques are described and discussed in this review."
182;Comparing the effect of climate change on agricultural competitiveness in developing and developed countries;"Agus Dwi Nugroho a,b,* , Imade Yoga Prasada c , Zoltan Lakner d";"Climate change and agriculture are inextricably linked and influence one another. Many studies have been conducted on the topic, but none have focused on developing and developed countries. This study aims to investigate the relationship between climate change and agricultural competitiveness in developing and developed countries. This study examined data from 71 developing countries and 24 developed countries from 1990 to 2020 used the three-stage least squares method. This study found that agricultural competitiveness raises temperatures in developing countries while decreasing temperatures in developed countries. The temperature change has the same effect in developing and developed countries, namely reducing the agricultural competitiveness. However, agricultural competitiveness in developed countries is more sensitive to temperature changes. Other explanatory variables have varying effects on temperature and agricultural competitiveness. We propose the use of technology in agricultural business management, as well as each country?s commitment to increase agricultural competitiveness while manage rise in temperatures. Every country must also make efforts to maintain currency stability, be prudent in dealing with economic openness, increase agricultural labor productivity, and improve agricultural business actors? education."
183;"Evaluating agricultural drought and flood abrupt alternation: A case study of cotton in the middle-and-lower Yangtze River, China";"Long Qian a , Huayue Meng b , Xiaohong Chen a,* , Rong Tang b";"Drought and flood abrupt alternations (DFAA) are new challenges under climate change with particular emphasis on its affects related to agriculture. However, current regional DFAA analysis research rarely investigates agricultural DFAA with special regards to agricultural elements. In this work, a method based on a daily scale index named the standardized antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index (SAPEI) and crop characteristics was established to investigate the characteristics of agricultural DFAA during cotton growth stages in the middle-andlower Yangtze River (MLRYR) during 1961?2020. Additionally, the influence of DFAA on cotton climatic yield in response to flooding and drought was examined by multiple regression. The results demonstrate that the SAPEI efficiently described the relations between cotton climatic yield and the intensities of cotton drought and flood and well characterized cotton DFAA events, especially for short-term events. The most recent decade over the past six decades has seen the most frequent cotton DFAA events, and the only significant trend (p < 0.05) of cotton DFAA frequency was an upward trend in Jiangsu Province. In addition, the middle growth stage of cotton was the most DFAA-affected period within a year. Cotton drought-flood alternations (DF) were more common than flood-drought alternations (FD). The most DF-prone and FD-prone regions differed greatly, but the northeastern MLRYR was the most DFAA-prone region. In all provinces, the cotton DFAA frequency was significantly and positively related to the cotton drought frequency. Finally, the relations between cotton climatic yield and the intensities of drought and flood were much less significant in the years with more DFAA events than in other years, indicating an obvious negative interaction between drought and flood in cotton DFAA events. This finding, at the regional scale, confirmed previous field-scale conclusions on cotton responses to DFAA stress. In summary, this work provides references for agricultural water management in adapting to climate change."
184;"Bioenergy consumption, carbon emissions, and agricultural bioeconomic growth: A systematic approach to carbon neutrality in China";"Mansoor Ahmed Koondhar a , Zhixiong Tan b , Gazi Mahabubul Alam c , Zaid Ashiq Khan a , Linwei Wang a , Rong Kong a,*";"China is the world?s largest fossil fuel consumer and carbon emitter country. In September 2020, China pledged to reduce carbon emissions, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Therefore, this study aimed to contribute to the literature and show the pictorial nexus of bioenergy and fossil fuel consumption, carbon emission, and agricultural bioeconomic growth, a new pathway towards carbon neutrality. For this study, time-series data from 1971 to 2019 were used to analyze the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound testing and novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (DYNARDL) simulation models. Initially, the unit root tests results showed that all variables were stationarity at the level and first difference. The presence of cointegration between selected variables was confirmed by the results from ARDL bound test. In addition, the results of long-run and short-run nexus show an increase in bioenergy consumption that caused an increase in agricultural bioeconomic growth both in the long and short-run nexus. A decrease in fossil fuel consumption was shown to result in increased agricultural bioeconomic growth with respect to both long- and short-term effects. Furthermore, the results of the novel dynamic ARDL simulation model demonstrated that a 10% positive shock from bioenergy consumption caused an increase in agricultural bioeconomic growth, while at the same time, a 10% negative shock in bioenergy consumption led to a decrease. A 10% negative shock from fossil fuels caused an increase in agricultural bioeconomic growth, whereas a 10% positive shock from fossil fuels led to a decrease. Therefore, this study suggests that China needs to switch from fossil fuel and other non-renewable energy consumption to sources of bioenergy and other renewable energy consumption to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060."
185;A review of the large-scale application of autonomous mobility of agricultural platform;"Xu Ren, Bo Huang * , Hesheng Yin";"With the gradual disappearance of the demographic dividend and the labor shortage brought by the aging population, it is necessary and urgent to achieve a high degree of automation in agricultural scenarios. And with the development of science and technology, it has made certain progress. The autonomous mobility of platform plays a very important role in this progress. It expands the point-to-point agricultural activities of a single plant into the entire agriculture scene. The autonomous mobility of platforms is driven by the considerable multiple scenarios with different requirements and the need for an adaptable and reliable system. It contains mobile structure and motion control, which complement each other. This paper gives a detailed introduction and summarizes the state-of-the-art agricultural mobile platforms, sensor-based autonomous positioning and navigation methods, as well as their practical applications in different specific agricultural scenarios, especially harvesting task. It accounts for the absolute amount of labor in the overall agricultural task. Unlike, traditional industrial and urban, the agricultural scenarios have more unstructured complex environment. High autonomous mobility of the agricultural mobile platform, which requires the installation of more complex and comprehensive sensors sensitively perceive scene information and more intelligent positioning and navigation strategy, enable the mobile platform to securely, flexible perform agricultural tasks. Therefore, special attention is paid to the navigation strategy and mobile cruise strategy based on various sensor, to improve the autonomy of agricultural mobile platforms. It?s potential challenges and future are prospected based on the development trend of agricultural mobile platforms."
186;"Non-agricultural labor transfer, factor allocation and farmland yield: Evidence from the part-time peasants in Loess Plateau region of Northwest China";"Linfei Li a , Sufyan Ullah Khan b , Chenhao Guo a , Yanfen Huang a,* , Xianli Xia c,*";"Based on the theory of New Economic of Labor Migration (NELM) and Induced Technological Change, this study takes 935 part-time households in the Loess Plateau region as the research object. The study analyzes the current situation of non-agricultural labor transfer and agricultural production, and describes the intrinsic relationship and mechanism of the action between non-agricultural labor transfer, factor allocation and farmland output-rate. The direct and indirect effects of non-agricultural labor transfer on unit farmland output are tested empirically through the mediating effect model and the moderating effect model, and the effectiveness of the mechanism of action is further tested using the moderated mediation model (Bootstrap). The empirical results show that nonagricultural labor transfer has significant and negative impact on farmland output. Moreover, labor-substituting factor inputs play a partially mediating role between non-agricultural labor transfer and farmland output-rate, with a mediating effect size of - 1.552, accounting for 53.073 % of the total effect. The findings also demonstrate that higher the proportion of slope cropland, the smaller the positive effect of labor substitute factor input on farmland output. Similarly, non-agricultural labor transfer has a significant and negative effect on farmland output for low-part-time peasants and cash crops, the negative effect on peasants participating in farmland transfer is not significant, and a larger negative effect on distant working peasants. Based on the above findings, this paper puts forward targeted policy recommendations for optimizing the allocation of agricultural factors and improving agricultural production efficiency, aiming to provide a theoretical basis and decision-making reference for ensuring abundant grain production and agricultural harvest in the Loess Plateau region, lifting peasants out of poverty and increasing their income, and realizing the rural revitalization strategy."
187;Long-term responses in different karst agricultural production systems to farm management and climate change: A comparative prefecture-scale study in Southwest China;"Yetong Li a , Zhuodong Zhang a,* , Shiliang Liu b , Zihao Cao a,c , Qihua Ke a , Lei Chen a , Guopeng Wang a";"Rapid shifts have occurred in the agricultural production systems of the karst regions in Southwest China to meet increasing food demands. The responses of agricultural production vary under different degree of rocky desertification. However, the interactive effects of related driving factors on the food production sustainability of local crops are unknown. In this study, we quantified the impacts of seven key indicators?population, cropland area, multiple cropping index, irrigation area, fertilizer use, temperature and precipitation?on agricultural production in three rocky desertification grade regions from 1960 to 2011. We also classified these indicators into three categories: population, farm management and climate change. The results showed that farm management and population were the main drivers of increased food crop production, contributing 79.7% and 17%, respectively. In contrast, climate change had a limited influence on agricultural production. With increases in crop yield, the influences of some indicators were enhanced, and the negative impact on the environment was also increased therefore, the sustainability of agricultural production systems could be adversely affected in the future. The agricultural production systems in mild rocky desertification areas (Zunyi) could meet the current food demands, while the areas with moderate and severe rocky desertification (Bijie and Qianxinan, respectively) are faced with substantial pressure. Although continuous improvements in agricultural production efficiency due to advances in modern science, technology and management have partly mitigated environmental pressure, rocky desertification poses a challenge to the sustainable development of agriculture in Southwest China. These findings provide a reference for adjusting farm management practices and climate change countermeasures in regions with different degrees of rocky desertification to achieve agricultural production sustainability in the future."
188;"Nexus between economic growth, energy use, agricultural productivity, and carbon dioxide emissions: new evidence from Nepal";"Asif Raihana,* , Almagul Tuspekova b";"Global climate change, exacerbated by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, notably carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, provides huge risks to the environment, development, and sustainability. This study empirically investigated the dynamic impacts of economic growth, fossil fuel energy use, renewable energy use, and agricultural productivity on CO2 emissions in Nepal. Time series data from 1990 to 2019 were utilized by applying the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach followed by the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) method. The ARDL bounds test revealed evidence of cointegration among the variables. The DOLS findings revealed that an increase in economic growth and fossil fuel energy use by 1% for each variable would increase CO2 emissions by 0.61% and 0.67%, respectively. Conversely, a 1% increase in renewable energy use and agricultural productivity may lead to CO2 emissions reduction by 3.65% and 0.41% in the long run. The estimated results are robust to alternative estimators such as fully modified least squares (FMOLS) and canonical cointegrating regression (CCR). In addition, the pairwise Granger causality test was utilized to capture the causal linkage between the variables. This article put forward policy recommendations aimed at sustainable development by establishing strong regulatory policy instruments to reduce environmental degradation."
189;"Spatiotemporal variability and trends of rainfall and temperature in the tropical moist montane ecosystem: Implications to climate-smart agriculture in Geshy watershed, Southwest Ethiopia";"Girma Tilahun Getnet a,b,* , Amare Bantider Dagnew b , Desalegn Yayeh Ayal b";"This paper examines the spatio-temporal trends and variability of temperature and rainfall in Geshi Watershed of South Western Ethiopia. The available gridded daily rainfall and temperature data managed by Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency (NMA) for 1986?2020 was used. Spatial variability and temporal trends of temperature and rainfall were analyzed using XLSTAT and ArcGIS 10.8 software. The Mann-Kendall test was used for trend analysis. Variability analysis was also done using the coefficient of variation and precipitation concentration index. The study reveals constant increasing trends in rainfall and insignificant and high variability but increasing trends of temperature. The variabilities and trends justify the spatio-temporal differences along different seasons (spring locally known as ?belg?, summer locally known as ?kiremt?, and annual). The watershed is characterized by high to moderate rainfall coefficient of variation, significant years of high concentration of rainfall, and substantial negative annual rainfall anomalies that severe variability was found in the summerseason. These variabilities and trends, especially late onset and early cessation of rainfall and increase in temperature created favorable conditions for insect and disease proliferation that eventually reduces agricultural productivity. Household income, which is solely based on agricultural production, declines which in turn affects household resilience. Maladaptation in the form of deforestation, fuelwood and charcoal selling, agricultural land expansion, and practicing input-intensive agriculture that contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionsare taken as an alternative livelihood strategy. In conclusion, spatiotemporal variabilities and trends of rainfall and temperature affect agricultural productivity, reduced household resilience leading to low adaptive capacity, and increased GHG emissions, which are known to be major pillars of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). In response, area-specific CSA technologies such as small-scale irrigation, improved animal husbandry, efficient inorganic fertilizer use, using manure, crop residue management, using high-yielding improved crop varieties, and using disease-resistant varieties are recommended."
190;Can agricultural credit subsidies affect county-level carbon intensity in China?;"Zhuang Zhang a , Yun Tian a , You-Hua Chen b,c, ?";"Relieving credit restrictions can change the high-pollution producing style for agriculture, which is critical for low-carbon development. Using the time-varying difference in difference (DID) method and county-level panel data from 2000 to 2018 in China, we find that the agricultural credit subsidies (ACS) policy significantly reduces carbon intensity in the treated counties. For this effect, agricultural scale expansion and technology adoption are potential mechanisms. We further find that the effects are more salient in the areas with more primary industry outputs and high carbon emissions. Besides, other approaches show that our conclusions are robust. Subsidies for the banks agricultural affairs direct credit into the agriculture sector and thereby promote carbon intensity reduction."
191;Influence of irrigation and groundwater on the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought;"Li Fawen a,* , Zhang Manjing b , Zhao Yong c,* , Jiang Rengui d";"Research on drought propagation is of great significance for the scientific prediction of agricultural drought and reducing drought losses. In this study, based on the daily scale standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and soil water deficit index (SWDI), the effects of irrigation and groundwater level change on the development and spread of drought were studied, and the dynamic change in the spread time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought was explored through a sliding window. Additionally, the critical value of the response of agricultural drought to meteorological drought was calculated. The results indicated that (1) under Scenario-1 (groundwater depth 19.4 m, no irrigation), Scenario-2 (groundwater depth 2 m, no irrigation), and Scenario-3 (groundwater depth 19.4 m, irrigation), the lag times of agricultural drought on meteorological drought were 23 d, 42 d, and 30 d, respectively. (2) The drought propagation time under Scenario-1 and 2 exhibited a significant upwards trend. According to the factor contribution rate and cross-wavelet analysis, the rising trend of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the decreasing trend of the Pacific Decade Oscillation (PDO) led to the shortening of sunshine duration, which was the key reason for the extension of drought propagation time. (3) Under Scenario-1, the critical values of the agricultural drought response to meteorological drought duration and intensity were 4.9 and 0.9, respectively. Under Scenario-2, the critical values increased to 5.1 and 2.0, revealing that the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought would slow down when groundwater rose to an appropriate position."
192;The impact of China?s new agricultural subsidy policy on grain crop acreage;"Pengfei Fan a , Ashok K. Mishra b , Shuyi Feng a , Min Su a , Stefan Hirsch c,*";"As China is the world?s largest producer, importer, and consumer of agricultural products, the new agricultural subsidy policy has significant implications for the global agricultural market. We assess the impact of the new agricultural subsidy on the grain crops acreage by applying difference-in-difference estimation to the China Rural Household Panel Survey (CRHPS) data. Results indicate that the new agricultural subsidy increases grain crop acreage. The results remain robust even after controlling for the effects from other policy measures. The study also identified the mechanism behind the subsidy?s effect. Namely, the new program encourages operators to increase their grain crop acreage by renting more land and increasing the share of grain crops grown. Regarding heterogeneity of the results, the subsidy policy has a more positive impact on grain crop growers than on mixed crop growers, it does not affect large farms (>100 Mu) and its influence is greater among operators in the Northern regions of China. Our findings are relevant for understanding the effect of China?s new agricultural subsidy policies and agrarian market reforms."
193;Climate change-induced aridity is affecting agriculture in Northeast Italy;"Eugenio Straffelini * , Paolo Tarolli";"CONTEXT: The Mediterranean basin and specifically Northeast Italy are recognised as climate change hotspots. The latter is a key socio-economic area in Europe among the most agriculturally productive. However, increasingly frequent drought periods (typical of drier climates) are threatening agriculture. An extreme event occurred in the summer of 2022. It dramatically affected northern Italy, through high temperatures, water shortages and indirect processes (such as saltwater intrusion in the Po River Delta). OBJECTIVE: The objective is to map and quantify the agricultural areas in Northeast Italy at risk of climate zone shift due to human-induced climate change, providing a comprehensive overview of the main threatened agricultural systems and supporting the use of projections through historical data analysis. METHODS: We compared the distribution of current (1980 > 2016) and future (2071 > 2100 RCP8.5 scenario) climate zones for 8 main agricultural systems in 14 key provinces in Northeast Italy. Further analyses were performed on historical data to support future climate projections and to analyse agricultural drought during extreme events: (1) a multi-temporal Aridity Index (AI) to investigate aridification dynamics (2) a focus on the 2022 event (drought and temperature extremes, a situation that is likely to occur more often in the future), combining a Vegetation Health Index (VHI) with a zonal investigation of high Land Surface Temperature (LST) (3) a climate focus for the Po River Delta cultural landscape. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the climate in Northeast Italy is evolving towards drier conditions, posing a challenge to agriculture. The Adriatic coast could become an Arid zone, a finding in line with historical observations. Rice fields will be most at risk (76% of their surface could become Arid in the future), as well as the irrigated lands that are essential for food security (around 20% expected in the Arid zone). Worthy is what is foreseen for crops on slopes (often not irrigated), which may experience drier summers (60% of the surface). SIGNIFICANCE: We identified the areas at risk of climate change at the farm scale in Northeast Italy, mapping where the threatened fields are located, what their extent is, and which agricultural systems are currently implemented. Such information would facilitate early action, guiding large-scale planning towards more resilient agriculture. Findings could promote sustainable water management plans, open the debate on which crops are worth growing based on future climate, and inspire more localised studies in the design of mitigation measures.

194;Understanding the nature of early agriculture in the Central Plains of China (ca. 2600BC?221BC): Non-urban settlement perspective through archaeobotanical and stable isotope analysis;"Dawei Tao a,* , Ruijin Zhang a , Junjie Xu a,* , Longlong Zheng a,* , Guowen Zhang b , Guoshuo Zhang a";"Agriculture constitutes the economic foundation for social complexity and civilization process in ancient China. Agricultural practices of ordinary settlements as the basic unit of society could reflect the overall agricultural production and technology and also a basic guarantee for the sustained development and stable operation of the society. The Central Plains of China witnessed the social transition, the onset and development of state-level societies, urbanization process, and the boom of bronze civilization during the Longshan period to Eastern Zhou (ca. 2600BC?221BC). This study primarily aimed to assess the coping strategies of non-urban settlements and the nature of agriculture in Central Plains during this social transformation and development period. It examined the era?s agricultural strategies by reporting the archeaobotanical remains and stable isotopic data of charred grains and legume seeds from the Huqiugang site, a long-lived settlement lasting from Longshan to Eastern Zhou in this area. Findings show that Huqiugang inhabitants adopted active agricultural strategies to confront the social changes and climate fluctuations during Longshan to Eastern Zhou, including effective adjustment of the crop structure, improved crop management and expansion of the agrarian field to cultivate multiple crops. Combined with archaeobotanical remains and stable isotope values of charred plant remains from ordinary contemporaneous sites in the Central Plains, the characteristics of agriculture in non-urban settlements during Longshan to Eastern Zhou in the Central Plains are revealed, including stability of diversified crop patterns, innovation of agricultural technology, and flexibility of agricultural practices, which all contributed to the sustainability of agriculture in this area. Sustainable agriculture provided the economic guarantee of social resilience in the period of social transformation and development in the Central Plains, and was the important driving force for the emergence and development of state-level society, urbanization, and the prosperity of bronze civilization in the Central Plains during Longshan to Eastern Zhou."
195;Artificial intelligence-based techniques for adulteration and defect detections in food and agricultural industry: A review;"Suhaili Othman a,b , Nidhi Rajesh Mavani a , M.A. Hussain c , Norliza Abd Rahman a , Jarinah Mohd Ali a,*";"Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have evolved into practical, fast and effective tools in combination with detecting devices for quality assessment, particularly in adulteration and deficiency detection in the food and agriculture industry. This review discusses recent advances in AI techniques and their integration with a variety of sensing devices to detect food adulteration and agricultural product defects. The results obtained from the sensors require the application of case-specific AI techniques aimed at improving the acquired high-dimensional dataset?s understanding, as well as classification and prediction. It is evident that the coupling of AI technique and sensors have shown promising outcome between 81.2 and 100% range of accuracy in adulteration and defect detection for food and agricultural product. The research trends and guidelines are also proposed with the aim to provide references and guidance to both scientific researchers and industrial players in the field of food and agriculture quality assessment. The challenges and prospects regarding AI techniques were also revealed. Furthermore, future potential developments, new sensors and novel algorithms must be pursued and validated. Future AI detection of food adulteration and agricultural product defects can be anticipated, especially with the integration of various sensors and the application of deep learning algorithms. Real-time monitoring and predictive modeling may also receive great attention, which could assist to avoid quality problems before they arise, lower the risk of fraud, and ensure high-valuable products."
196;Using isotopic tracers to enhance routine watershed monitoring ? Insights from an intensively managed agricultural catchment;"Elisha Persaud a,b,* , Jana Levison a,b , Genevieve Ali c,d,e , Clare Robinson f";"Experimental (research-based) and non-research-based watershed monitoring programs often differ with respect to sampling frequency, monitored variables, and monitoring objectives. Isotopic variables, which are more commonly incorporated in research-based programs, can provide an indication of water sources and the transit time of water in a catchment. These variables may be a valuable complement to traditional water quality monitoring variables and have the potential to support improved hydrologic process-related insights from long term monitoring programs that typically have low resolution sampling. The purpose of this investigation is to explore the utility of incorporating isotopic variables (specifically d18O, d2 H, and 222Rn) into routine monthly sampling regimes by comparing insights gained from these variables to monitoring only specific conductivity and chloride. A complete annual cycle of monthly groundwater and surface water monitoring data collected from the Upper Parkhill watershed in southwestern Ontario, Canada was used to characterize baseline watershed conditions, evaluate watershed resilience to climate change, and examine contamination vulnerability. Study results provide an improved understanding of appropriate tracer use in agricultural regions with isotopic variables able to provide important insights into the seasonality of hydrologic phenomena, such as the timing of groundwater recharge. A comparison of monitoring variables to present-day hydro-meteorological conditions suggests the importance of a winter dominated hydrologic regime and the potential influence of changes in precipitation on groundwater-surface water interactions. Estimated transit time dynamics indicate the likelihood for rapid contaminant transport through surface and shallow subsurface flow and highlight the possible effects of agricultural tile drainage. The sampling approach and data analysis methods adopted in this study provide the basis for improving routine watershed monitoring programs in agricultural regions."
197;Contextualising farmer perspectives on regenerative agriculture: A post-productivist future?;"Jonathan D. Beacham b,* , Peter Jackson a , Coline C. Jaworski c , Anna Krzywoszynska d , Lynn V. Dicks e";"Within agri-food scholarship, longstanding debates have focused on the empirical applicability and conceptual utility of differing agricultural paradigms. These have often dovetailed with considerations around the future of agriculture in countries such as the UK given a shift in emphasis away from the central tenets of a high-input, yield-oriented productivism. Alternative diagnoses, particularly in notions of a post-productivist paradigm, have proven influential in capturing broad changes in the restructuring of agricultural activity. Whilst debates around the characterisation of these paradigms continue, they highlight distinct contestations in broader (and shifting) questions around what agriculture should be ?for?, e.g. whether environmental ?goods? should be valued more highly than material production. Situating our paper within these ongoing debates, we draw on farmer perspectives in examining the adoption of regenerative agricultural practices in two farmer clusters in the East and South-West of England respectively. As a diverse array of practices which appear favourably positioned in a post-Brexit policy environment, we explore the ways in which regenerative agriculture can be understood as seeking to reconcile productivist and post-productivist tendencies. Drawing attention to the tensions, contradictions and uncertainties at play in these farmer perspectives, we highlight: the environmental and emotional appeal of regenerative agriculture compared to its adoption for more pragmatic (economic) reasons the parallels and differences between regenerative agriculture and organic production and the multiple sources of trusted information drawn upon by farmers in an uncertain policy environment. We conclude the paper by reflecting on the need to better contextualise and conceptualise contemporary interest in regenerative agriculture within longer theoretical lineages, in which the voice of farmers themselves must be central."
198;Preparation of magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers for the selective extraction of strobilurin fungicides in agricultural products;"Yexuan Hu a , Tongqing Liu a , Shuanglei Wang b , Meijin Lv a , Yongxin She c , Bin Cao a , Ziping Zhang a , Xiaolin Cao a,*";"In this study, the novel magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers were successfully synthesized by surface imprinting technique and used as magnetic adsorbent for extracting six strobilurin fungicides from agricultural products. The magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers showed the typical core-shell structure with high maximum adsorption capacity (42.7 mg/g) and rapid adsorption equilibration (3 min) and specific recognition ability. The parameters (elution solvent, elution time, adsorption time, loading solvent and solution pH) in magnetic solid phase extraction were evaluated. Under the optimum adsorption and desorption condition, the magnetic solid phase extraction process based on magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers coupled with high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed for the sensitive detection of strobilurin fungicides from agricultural products. The developed method presented good linearity (5?200 ng/mL) with correlation coefficients (R2 ) = 0.9990. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.03?0.49 ng/g and 0.09?1.64 ng/g, respectively. At the three different concentration (20, 50, 100 ng/g) spiked in agricultural products, the good recovery (71.5%- 115.8%) was obtained and the relative standard deviations were below 8.3%. These results indicated that this established method was sensitive, accurate, selective and reproducible."
199;Co-explosivity versus leading effects: Evidence from crude oil and agricultural commodities;"Ghassen El Montasser b , Mohamed Malek Belhoula b , Lanouar Charfeddine a,1,*";"Unlike previous studies investigating the interdependence and co-movements between different commodity prices, this paper examined the co-explosivity versus leading effects between the Brent oil prices and agricultural commodity prices. Empirically, we first date-stamped bubbles in the Brent and a set of agricultural commodities. Second, we examined possible existence of co-explosivity between these commodities? prices. Finally, by using predictive quantile regressions, we examined the leading effects of the crude oil market on agricultural commodity markets and vice versa. The results provide strong evidence for the presence of bubbles in the Brent oil price and the eight selected agricultural commodities? prices. In particular, we found that the year 2008 had the largest number of Brent-related bubbles, as well as a large proportion of bubbles in the studied agricultural commodities. However, although we found no evidence of co-explosivity between the different commodities, the results highlight strong evidence of the presence of leading effects from Brent oil prices to agricultural commodities for different lags. The reverse leading effect was found for only the corn and soybean commodities. The important implications for investors and market participants were presented and discussed."
200;Connectedness between oil and agricultural commodity prices during tranquil and volatile period. Is crude oil a victim indeed?;"Yanpeng Sun a , Nawazish Mirza b , Abdul Qadeer c,d , Hsin-Pei Hsueh e,*";"Increasing financialization of energy and commodity markets offer a variety of tradeoff for the investors and consumers. On the one hand, this increased financialization of the two markets helps investors design a welldiversified investment portfolio with assets from different asset categories. However, at the same time, this increases the connectedness between the two markets significantly, which may have strong implications for investors and consumers. In this paper, we examine the long-term connectedness and causality between Crude oil and agricultural commodity prices. The advantage of long-term time series is that we may be able to uncover the demand and supply shocks that originated in both markets during the tranquil period and the shocks during the volatile period such as the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, we employ the full bootstrap sample and rolling window causality tests primarily. Our results are surprisingly different from most of the studies that have held oil prices responsible for causing changes in agricultural commodity prices (ACP). In contrast, our results confirm the presence of bidirectional causality and show that Oil prices are as much affected by the ACP as vice versa. This significant reverse causality running from ACP to Oil prices can open up a completely new interpretation domain. Finally, it is surprisingly interesting that both ACP and Oil prices remain immune to the shocks that originated in both markets during the entire time period of the COVID19 pandemic."
201;Mapping crop producer perceptions: The role of global drivers on local agricultural land use in Brazil;"Yue Dou a,b,c,*,1 , Ramon Felipe Bicudo da Silva b,d,2 , Mateus Batistella d,e , Sara Torresf,g , Emilio Moran b,h , Jianguo Liu b";"Agricultural trade and climate change have altered land cover and land use worldwide. For example, the recent growth of international soybean demand has been associated with 1.3 Mha primary Amazon forest loss and up to 13-fold increase in double-cropping areas in Brazil. Many studies have tried to understand which and how global and local drivers affect deforestation and agricultural intensification processes at the landscape level, yet few have incorporated the direct perspectives of actual land users. Under the influence of a variety of social, economic, and cultural factors, producers are the ones who make decisions that will cause a significant impact on the environment. In this paper, we adopted Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs), a semi-quantitative modeling approach to represent complex decision-making systems, and we modeled land use and agricultural management perceptions of 27 crop producers from the three states - Mato Grosso, Goias, ? and Tocantins - important soybean production and export areas in Brazil. We analyzed individual models and integrated them into aggregated regional models to compare individual and regional differences among the producers. In addition, we simulated how producers from the three states will make land-use decisions under more trade and extreme climatic events scenarios using the FCMs. Our results indicate that extreme climatic events are among the most important factors producers consider when it comes to the sustainability of their operations. Climate change scenarios have a stronger overall impact than trade scenarios on local land-use changes, causing a 12% reduction in total agricultural production. The improvement of technology packages can effectively mitigate climate change risks and has an overall positive impact on land-use intensification than expansion. On the other hand, sharing accurate climate information and socio-economic improvements such as credits have larger impacts on agricultural expansion than productivity itself. Moreover, the model complexity shows differences among the three states. Soybean trade has more weight in the perception of producers in Goias ? and Tocantins than Mato Grosso. Based on the results, we discuss the importance of co-designing place-based, alternative policies and mitigation options for both agricultural intensification and environmental conservation, taken into consideration through the intertwined global and local forces."
202;"The role of green financing, agriculture development, geopolitical risk, and natural resource on environmental pollution in China";"Yuqiu Du, Wendi Wang *";"Due to climatic uncertainties, the biosphere experienced tremendous growth of anthropogenic activities, which eradicates the sustainable environment for living beings. Thus, the continuous rise in environmental pollution detains the attention of the environmentalist to discover strategic approaches to maintain the green ecological era. Therefore, the present study aims to identify the role of green financing, agriculture development, geopolitical risk, and natural resources on China?s environmental pollution (CO2 emission). We use time series data ranging from 1995 to 2020 using the Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lags (QARDL) method proposed by (Cho et al., 2015). Further, we use Causality-in-Quantile to check the asymmetric association. However, the empirical results of causality signify an asymmetric relationship and bi-directional causality among all the variables. In addition, the results of QARDL indicate the negative and significant p-values of error correction parameters throughout the qualities, which confirmed the reversions to the long-term association between the determinants and CO2 emission. Whereas across all the quantiles, the negative and significant association of green financing (GFIN) with CO2 emission in QARDL is found, and other factors such as geopolitical risk (GRP), agriculture development (AGR), and Natural resources (NNR) show a positive and significant association with CO2 emission mainly in the upper quantiles. While the results of short-run QARDL analysis indicate that GFIN, GPR, and NNR are positively associated with CO2 emission, the significance level varies, GPR and GFIN are highly significant with environmental pollution at upper quantiles (0.05?0.40), and NNR is highly significant at all quantiles (0.05?0.95). Based on these estimations, some concrete implications are proposed for the practitioners to minimize the repercussion of CO2 emissions in China."
203;Effect of different macrophytes on crop cultivation under floating agriculture system for climate change adaptation in Bangladesh;"Dipalok karmaker a , Md. Al-Imran a , Shawon Mitra a , Md. Alimur Rahman b , Subroto K. Das a,*";"The adverse effects of climate change, including rising sea levels and frequent floods, pose significant challenges to agricultural systems, particularly in low-lying countries like Bangladesh. To address these challenges, floating agriculture systems have emerged as a climate-resilient alternative for crop cultivation. Floating agriculture is a traditional agricultural system where aquatic free-floating macrophytes are used as the medium for the growth of plants. This cultivation system is traditionally used for seedling development in the south and south-western regions (Barishal, Pirojpur, and Gopalganj) of Bangladesh. However, very little scientific attention has been given to using macrophytes in crop production and preparing floating beds. Therefore, the present investigation has been carried out to select suitable macrophytes for preparing a floating bed by assaying the condition of the floating bed and the morphological and yield-related factors of cultivated crops during the Robi season in 2021. Five different macrophytes, namely, Salvinia molesta, Pistia stratiotes, Lemna minor, Salvinia cucullate, and Azolla pinnata, have been used as mulching material, which has been conducted in a Completely Randomized Block Design (RCBD). The plant material BARI tomato-14 has been transplanted on the floating beds to assess the effect of macrophytes on crop production. The results of the present investigation reveal that different macrophytes have distinct effects on tomato plants? growth and yield-related parameters in floating agriculture systems. Salvinia cucullata shows a better response in the stability of the floating bed, whereas Salvinia molesta exhibits better responses as mulching material on yield-related parameters of cultivated crops."
204;Navigating route planning for multiple vehicles in multifield agriculture with a fast hybrid algorithm;"Amalia Utamima a,* , Torsten Reiners b";"Optimisation of route planning is becoming increasingly valuable aspect in agriculture. This study focuses on Agricultural Route Planning (ARP) in multifield areas (with a specific entrance point), incorporating several heterogeneous agricultural machines. The aim of this research is to improve the route planning of (semi- )autonomous machines by producing more efficient route plans. The problem sets of ARP contain both medium and large numbers of tracks consisting of irregular and rectangular fields. This research proposes a Fast Hybrid Algorithm (FHA) to address this problem. FHA incorporates various combinatorial operators into its structure. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to Tabu Search, (Improved) Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimisation, FHA can reduce the distance travelled by an average of 16.21%. Furthermore, the efficiency of FHA is also reflected in its running time, which saves up to 54.23% compared to the other methods."
205;Towards autonomous mapping in agriculture: A review of supportive technologies for ground robotics;"Diego Tiozzo Fasiolo, Lorenzo Scalera * , Eleonora Maset, Alessandro Gasparetto";"This paper surveys the supportive technologies currently available for ground mobile robots used for autonomous mapping in agriculture. Unlike previous reviews, we describe state-of-the-art approaches and technologies aimed at extracting information from agricultural environments, not only for navigation purposes but especially for mapping and monitoring. The state-of-the-art platforms and sensors, the modern localization techniques, the navigation and path planning approaches, as well as the potentialities of artificial intelligence towards autonomous mapping in agriculture are analyzed. According to the findings of this review, many examples of recent mobile robots provide full navigation and autonomous mapping capability. Significant resources are currently devoted to this research area, in order to further improve mobile robot capabilities in this complex and challenging field."
206;Local rainfall forecast knowledge across the globe used for agricultural decision-making;"Spyridon Paparrizos * , Emmanuel M.N.A.N. Attoh, Samuel J. Sutanto, Nina Snoeren, Fulco Ludwig";"The agriculture sector is vital to the worlds economy and weather and climate are key drivers that affect the productivity and profitability of agricultural systems. At the same time, weather-related risks pose significant challenges to farmers livelihoods. Although scientific weather forecast (SFK) is available, many farmers, especially in the Global South, have limited access to this information, and they rely on local forecast knowledge (LFK) to make farming decisions. Many studies also recognize the value of combining both forecasting systems yet, unlike SFK which is readily available, indicators for LFK needs to be collected first. Therefore, this study identifies and documents the spatial distribution of LFK use for agriculture across the globe through a systematic literature review. Results show that a high number of LFK regions with a total of around 1350 local environmental indicators were found in Africa and Asia and less in South and North America. The low usability of scientific weather forecasts is perceived as the main reason farmers use LFK instead of SFK, yet the accessibility of LFK both for scientists and users, needs to be improved. Indicators based on animals and meteorology appeared to be more frequently used for weather predictions than plant- and astronomy-based indicators. Digitalizing the LFK inventory and collecting more detailed information about the regions where LFK was identified could promote and foster research on integrating scientific and local forecasting systems. This study will draw attention to the importance of LFK in weather forecasting, maintain this knowledge and enhance it."
207;Exploring the effect of climate risk on agricultural and food stock prices: Fresh evidence from EMD-Based variable-lag transfer entropy analysis;"Zouhaier Dhifaoui a , Rabeh Khalfaoui b , Sami Ben Jabeur c , Mohammad Zoynul Abedin d,e,*";"Climate has traditionally played an important role in the development of countries, owing to its inherent relationship with agricultural output and pricing. This study explores one such association between the most well-known climate anomaly, the El Ni?34 Southern Oscillation, and international commodity prices of agriculture and food indexes. This study addresses the potentially causal effect of El Ni?34 on international agricultural and food stock prices. To do so, we develop a novel approach: the empirical mode decomposition variable-lag transfer entropy (EMD-VL transfer entropy) by combining the variable-lag transfer entropy framework and the empirical mode decomposition. The evidence reveals the following major results. First, climate shocks affect global agricultural stock prices in the short-term. Second, significant transfer entropy from El Ni?34 to food index appeared at mid- and long-term business cycles. Third, unidirectional causal effect from climate shocks to agricultural and food stock prices is more intense in the short business cycle attesting to the impact of climate shocks on the food market, which is especially visible in the short-term horizon. Finally, our proposed method exceeds the traditional variable-lag transfer entropy by detecting such causal interplay at various business cycles, which is useful for investors and policymakers."
208;A calibration method for contact parameters of agricultural particle mixtures inspired by the Brazil nut effect (BNE): The case of tiger nut tuber-stem-soil mixture;"Shengwei Zhang a , Ruiyu Zhang a , Qingqiu Cao a , Yan Zhang a , Jun Fu a,b , Xiangyu Wen c , Hongfang Yuan a,*";"The lack of calibration methods for the contact parameters of agricultural particle mixtures limits the numerical simulation optimization of agricultural equipment. In this study, a novel method for calibrating contact parameters in agricultural particle mixtures inspired by the Brazil nut effect was proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using a case study of a tiger nut tuber-stem-soil mixture. The intrinsic and contact parameters of monomaterials were first determined by conventional tests to provide data for vibration simulation tests. Vibration segregation tests were then performed on binary mixtures. The determination coefficient R2 between the physical and simulation data of the target particle volume concentration in the mixture was used as a response indicator. The second-order response surface regression model between the contact parameters and R2 was fitted by response surface methodology (RSM). The significance of the effect of the contact parameters on the indicator was quantified, and the optimal values of each parameter were determined. Finally, the applicability and accuracy of the calibrated parameters were verified using the self-flow sieving test. The results showed that the distribution of the mixture on the sieving surface and in the receiving box obtained from the calibrated test best matched the physical test results at this time, the maximum relative errors of the physical and simulated values of the mass percentages of the tuber, stem and soil in the bin were 8.2%, 7.6%, and 6.5%, respectively, indicating that the calibrated parameters have good applicability and accuracy. The calibration test method can guide the calibration of contact parameters for other agricultural particle mixtures."
209;"Global analysis of the correlation and propagation among meteorological, agricultural, surface water, and groundwater droughts";"Ying Liu a,b,**, Fuzhen Shan a , Hui Yue a,b,* , Xu Wang a , Yahui Fan a";"Groundwater drought monitoring relies on ground observation data, which cannot be used to reflect large-scale droughts in groundwater resources. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Satellite (GRACE) improved the situation and provided a new solution for groundwater drought research. However, the propagation relationship among global different drought types has not been fully explored. We employed CRU precipitation data, MERR2 reanalysis soil moisture data, GLDAS and GRACE data to calculate SPI (Standardized precipitation index), SSI (Standardized soil moisture index), SRI (Standardized runoff index), and GDI (Groundwater drought index), characterizing meteorological, agricultural, surface water and groundwater droughts, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient was adopted to study the propagation time of these four types of droughts. The results showed that the average propagation times for the different drought types are meteorological drought to surface water drought (3.5 months), meteorological drought to agricultural drought (5.7 months), agricultural drought to groundwater drought (12.97 months), surface water drought to groundwater drought (13.78 months), and meteorological drought to groundwater drought (14.47 months) from longest to shortest. (2) Climate conditions had a significant impact on the propagation time of different drought types. Low temperatures in cold climates resulted in the longest drought propagation time, while dry summer climates in temperate climates reduced drought propagation time. There were weaker propagation relationships in arid climates. In tropical climates, precipitation may not be the main driving factor for drought propagation. (3) Different land cover types show significant differences in the propagation of groundwater droughts, with forests having a longer propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought or surface water drought than grassland and cropland, and forests having the shortest propagation time when meteorological drought, agricultural drought, and surface water drought is propagated to groundwater drought. Woody plants have deeper root systems than herbaceous plants and can draw up deeper groundwater. Forests have greater water storage capacity and weaker groundwater recharge than grasslands and croplands, resulting in forests being more resistant to agricultural and surface water droughts and less resistant to groundwater droughts during meteorological droughts. This study can help to clarify the propagation laws among different drought types and understand the internal mechanisms that affect the development of drought during the water cycle."
210;RGB-D datasets for robotic perception in site-specific agricultural operations?A survey;"Polina Kurtser a,b,* , Stephanie Lowry a";"Fusing color (RGB) images and range or depth (D) data in the form of RGB-D or multi-sensory setups is a relatively new but rapidly growing modality for many agricultural tasks. RGB-D data have potential to provide valuable information for many agricultural tasks that rely on perception, but collection of appropriate data and suitable ground truth information can be challenging and labor-intensive, and high-quality publicly available datasets are rare. This paper presents a survey of the existing RGB-D datasets available for agricultural robotics, and summarizes key trends and challenges in this research field. It evaluates the relative advantages of the commonly used sensors, and how the hardware can affect the characteristics of the data collected. It also analyzes the role of RGB-D data in the most common vision-based machine learning tasks applied to agricultural robotic operations: visual recognition, object detection, and semantic segmentation, and compares and contrasts methods that utilize 2-D and 3-D perceptual data."
211;Water management dilemma in the agricultural sector of Iran: A review focusing on water governance;"Milad Nouri a,*,1 , Mehdi Homaee b,c , Luis S. Pereira d,* , Mohammad Bybordi e";"Around 90% of fresh renewable water is being used in Iran, indicating high water stress conditions across the country. Given that agricultural irrigation accounts for the majority of water use and consumption, any efforts to alleviate water stress must focus on enhancing agricultural water management. This paper aims to exhaustively compile the existing literature on the consequences and drivers of water insecurity, and to discuss the strategies balancing food and water security in the context of agricultural water management. Severe water scarcity can be largely attributed to governance gaps in Iran. In addition, inefficient water use, population growth, and warming/drying trends in the recent half a century are other major causes of the water scarcity. Groundwater over-depletion, quality deterioration of aquatic resources, decreased environmental flows and habitat destruction, and water conflicts are the significant consequences of improper water management in Iran. Several water productivity and conservation interventions, drawn from a rich literature, were suggested to improve agricultural water management in Iran. Furthermore, some water-food-energy nexus optimization methods, including changing cropping patterns, modifying energy tariffs, manipulating food diet, and reducing food waste, were discussed. Nexus-based strategies, which aim to achieve a balance between food production and water sustainability, are of high importance in reducing water consumption in the agricultural sector. While there has been a significant focus on improving water productivity and nexus-based measures, it is essential that policymakers prioritize enhancing the water governance dimensions to effectively address water scarcity and its consequences in Iran. In other words, improving the water governance system is a prerequisite for adopting any strategy aimed at enhancing agricultural water management and coping with water security."
212;Dryland agricultural expansion leads to lower content and higher variability of soil inorganic carbon in topsoil;"Bingming Chen a,b , Wenting Feng c , Xin Jing d , Yugang Wang a,b,e,*";"Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) is of key importance to the global carbon cycle and mitigating climate change. However, decades of agricultural expansion in the drylands have resulted in vast and fragmented agricultural landscapes and have potentially affected SIC. Previous studies investigating the impact of agricultural expansion on SIC have primarily focused on cultivation impacts, while ignoring edge effects from agricultural land boundaries. Here, we combined cultivation impacts with edge effects and fully evaluated the impacts of agricultural expansion on SIC. We conducted spatial statistical and buffer analyses using a SIC distribution map, which was developed using 388 sample points in 0 ? 20 cm topsoil over the Sangong River watershed in drylands of China. We found that decades-long agricultural expansion resulted in lower content and higher variability of SIC in topsoil. Specifically, cultivation decreased SIC content by 28.57% (1.64 g kg- 1 ) and increased SIC variability by 95.71% (0.67 g kg- 1 ) in agricultural lands. Edge effects altered SIC content by - 1.95?11.51% (- 0.11 to 0.54 g kg- 1 ) and increased SIC variability by 39.14% (0.34 g kg- 1 ) at edges. In addition, we found that fewer sampling points in areas with high SIC variability (e.g., agricultural lands and edges) decreased the estimation accuracy. Our study highlights the need for SIC conservation during dryland agricultural expansion. Also, it suggests that as many sampling points as possible should be set in high variability areas, which is especially useful for accurately estimating SIC distribution in drylands."
213;Modeling the response of agricultural non-point source pollution to planting structure and fertilization level in Erhai Lake Basin under low-latitude plateau climate;"Hao Zhao a , Yu Wang b , Yakun Dong b , Ziling He b , Peng Wang b , Honggang Zheng b,c , Jiafeng He a , Weijun Zeng b,c,d,*";"Agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution is the major contributor to pollution in the Erhai Lake Basin in northeastern China. The key to the control of NPS pollution is optimizing the planting structures and fertilization regimes. However, the interplay between the three remains unknown, and to identify their interaction is of great importance for NPS pollution control. In this study, experiments with varied crop rotations and fertilization schemes were performed in Erhai Lake Basin, based on which eight response models between the planting structure, fertilization level and NPS pollution under the low-latitude plateau climate were innovatively proposed and verified. The major findings are as follows: (1) there are six main planting structures in Erhai Lake Basin, among which rice-broad bean rotation takes up the largest area (35.72% of the total planting area), followed by corn-broad bean rotation (which accounts for 28.64% of the total area) (2) structural equation modeling reveals that in the study area, the total nitrogen (TN) was the largest contributor to agricultural NPS pollution (R2 = 0.90) while in rice-broad bean and corn-purple leaf lettuce rotations, total phosphorus (TP) was found to be the largest contributor to NPS pollution (R2 > 0.37) (3) climate, irrigation, planting structure and fertilization affected the indicators of agricultural NPS pollution, among which climate had the greatest impact on the TN content, with a path coefficient of 0.87 irrigation had the largest impact on the ammonia nitrogen (AN) content, with a path coefficient of 0.62 fertilization also had the largest impact on the TN content, with a path coefficient of 0.67 the percentage of the planting structure area affected TP (0.21), TN (0.29) and chemical oxygen demand (0.24) the crop area significantly affected the content of TP (0.45), TN (0.42) and chemical oxygen demand (0.51) and the crop yield significantly affected the content of TN (0.57). The research provides theoretical support for the prevention and control of agricultural NPS pollution in Erhai Lake Basin."
214;Can agricultural mechanization services narrow the income gap in rural China?;"Xiance Sang a , Xiaofeng Luo a,* , Amar Razzaq b,**, Yanzhong Huang c , Sahar Erfanian b";"This paper examines the impact of agricultural mechanization services (AMS) on rural household income and income gap, utilizing the recentered influence function regression method and publicly available data collected through the China Labor-force Dynamics Survey. The results of this study shed light on various impacts of AMS. First, agricultural mechanization services can significantly increase rural household income, but there is heterogeneity in the impact on rural household income in different quantiles. The effect of income growth on medium-income and low-income groups is greater. Second, agricultural mechanization services help to narrow the income gap between rural households and alleviate income inequality in rural areas. Third, the effect of agricultural mechanization services on reducing the income gap between rural households in the eastern and western regions is significantly stronger than that in the central region. Finally, further analysis based on income source structure reveals that agricultural mechanization services can significantly reduce the non-agricultural income gap of rural households, but the impact on the agricultural income gap is negligible. Our findings highlight the importance of government?s efforts in promoting the development of agricultural mechanization service market in order to improve the income inequality in rural areas."

N2O fluxes have high spatial and temporal variability and are often measured with the chamber technique. Therefore, continuous measurements of N2O fluxes are needed to better understand how N2O emissions are triggered and to reduce the uncertainty of annual N2O budget estimations. Here we present a two-year-long time series of continuous measurements of CO2 and N2O fluxes of a shallow-peated drained agricultural boreal peatland cultivated for grass silage. The fluxes were measured with the area-averaging eddy covariance technique. Several N2O peak events were observed throughout all seasons. The peaks were associated with meteorological or management events, such as soil thawing or freezing, precipitation, fertilization and glyphosate application. The annual N2O budget was 4.74 ?0.47 and 6.08 ?0.49 kg N2O-N ha-1 y -1 in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The annual CO2 budget, comprising the sum of net ecosystem exchange and biomass export, was 3.70 ?0.22 and 5.54 ?0.33 t CO2 -C ha-1 y -1 in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The N2O budget during the first, warmer winter was 106% higher than during the second, meteorologically more typical winter, due to the higher frequency of soil freezing?thawing cycles. The average annual N2O budget was 36%?50% lower than the IPCC Emission Factor (EF) while the CO2 budget was in accordance with the IPCC EF. CO2 emissions dominated the total CO2 -eq emissions of our site but N2O also had a significant contribution of 12%. Our results also suggest that glyphosate application enhanced N2O emissions in the last quarter of 2021. However, the full rotation should be measured to confirm whether there is a need to re-evaluate the N2O IPCC EF for ?grassland drained boreal? land-use class."

217;Bayesian vine copulas improve agricultural drought prediction for long lead times;"Haijiang Wu a,b , Xiaoling Su a,b,* , Vijay P. Singh c,d , Amir AghaKouchak e,f , Zhiyong Liu g,h";"Drought prediction models generally focus on shorter lead times (1?3-months) as their performance drastically declines at longer lead times (> 3 months). However, reliable agricultural drought prediction model with longer lead times is fundamental for reducing the impacts on agriculture sector, ecosystem, environment, and water resources. We propose a novel agricultural drought prediction model for long lead times by integrating vine copulas with Bayesian model averaging (hereafter, BVC model). Considering the previous meteorological drought, antecedent hot condition, and agricultural drought persistence as three predictors, the BVC model predicts agricultural drought with 1?6-month lead times. Here we focus on summer season (e.g., August) drought in China where agricultural drought impacts are more pronounced. Compared with optimal vine copula (OVC), average vine copula (AVC), and persistence-based models, the proposed BVC model performs better for 1?6- month lead times. Our findings can improve agricultural drought management, food security assessment, and early drought warning."

It evaluates the relative advantages of the commonly used sensors, and how the hardware can affect the characteristics of the data collected. It also analyzes the role of RGB-D data in the most common vision-based machine learning tasks applied to agricultural robotic operations: visual recognition, object detection, and semantic segmentation, and compares and contrasts methods that utilize 2-D and 3-D perceptual data."
227;Pixel-based mapping of open field and protected agriculture using constrained Sentinel-2 data;"Daniele la Cecilia a,*,1 , Manu Tom b,c , Christian Stamm a , Daniel Odermatt b,c";"Protected agriculture boosts the production of vegetables, berries and fruits, and it plays a pivotal role in guaranteeing food security globally in the face of climate change. Remote sensing is proven to be useful for identifying the presence of (low-tech) plastic greenhouses and plastic mulches. However, the classification accuracy notoriously decreases in the presence of small-scale farming, heterogeneous land cover and unaccounted seasonal management of protected agriculture. Here, we present the random forest-based pixel-level Open field and Protected Agriculture land cover Classifier (OPAC) developed using Sentinel-2 L2A data. OPAC is trained using tiles from Switzerland over 2 years and the Almeria region in Spain over 1 acquisition day. OPAC classifies eight land covers typical of open field and protected agriculture (plastic mulches, low-tech greenhouses and for the first time high-tech greenhouses). Finally, we assess (1) how the land covers in OPAC are labelled in the Sentinel-2 Scene Classification Layer (SCL) and (2) the correspondence between pixels classified as protected agriculture by OPAC and by the best performing Advanced Plastic Greenhouse Index (APGI). To reduce anthropogenic land covers, we constrain the classification task to agricultural areas retrieved from cadastral data or the Corine Land Cover map. The 5-fold cross-validation reveals an overall accuracy of 92% but other classification scores are moderate when keeping the separation among the three classes of protected agriculture. However, all scores substantially improve upon grouping the three classes into one (with an Intersection Over Union of 0.58 as an average among the scores of the three classes and of 0.98 for one single class). Given the recently acknowledged importance of Sentinel-2 Band 1 (central wavelength of 443 nm), the classification accuracy of OPAC for the Swiss small-scale farming is mostly limited by the band?s reduced spatial accuracy (60 m). A careful visual assessment indicates that OPAC achieves satisfactory generalization capabilities also in North European (the Netherlands) and four Mediterranean areas (Spain, Italy, Crete and Turkey) without the need of adding location and temporal specific information. There is good agreement among natural land covers classified by OPAC and the SCL. However, the SCL does not have a class for protected agriculture, the latter being often classified as clouds. APGI achieved similar to lower classification accuracies than OPAC. Importantly, the APGI classification task depends on a user-defined space- and time-specific threshold, whereas OPAC does not. Therefore, OPAC paves the way for rapid mapping of protected agriculture at continental scale."
228;Development of sustainable biopolymer-based composites for lightweight applications from agricultural waste biomass: A review;"Resego Phiri a , Sanjay Mavinkere Rangappa a, * , Suchart Siengchin a , Oluseyi Philip Oladijo b , Hom Nath Dhakal c";"The exhaustion of available natural resources and rising concerns about the environment have prompted a growing desire to discover innovative ways to produce environmentally friendly materials. In an effort to alleviate environmental issues connected to the disposal of agricultural waste, many studies have engaged on research pertaining to agricultural waste management. Every year, there are enormous amounts of agro based waste created, which is a major issue from an economic and environmental standpoint. These wastes can be utilized as secondary raw materials to create value-added products in accordance with the circular economys guiding principles. The exploitation of natural agricultural wastes has become critical for the development of sustainable biopolymer-based composites for lightweight applications. To this extent, this review presents an overview of the development and utilization of agricultural wastes to create biopolymers building blocks to be coupled with natural reinforcements for the fabrication of sustainable bio composites for lightweight applications. Common agricultural derived biopolymers are discussed. This review also highlights major bio composite fabrication methodologies and potential applications including challenges and opportunities in the development of sustainable biopolymer-based composites from agricultural waste biomass. It was concluded that the development of sustainable biopolymer-based composites from agricultural biomass offers a promising route towards a more environmentally friendly future."
229;Water-related limits to growth for agriculture in Iran;"Mostafa Khorsandi a,b,c,* , Tayebeh Omidi d , Pieter van Oel c";"Globally, agriculture is the primary water consumption sector. This study used water footprint (WF) as a bottom-up tool and satellite imagery as a top-down tool to estimate the internal water use (WU) in the agricultural sector in an innovative way to show the effects of water-intensive use in agriculture in an arid country. The WF of Iran has been quantified for 19 main crops and for related agricultural products exported from Iran to partner countries. Using a bottom-up approach, Iran?s total yearly agriculture net water consumption is estimated to be 42.43 billion cubic meters (BCM) per year. Out of 42.43 BCM total net internal water use, only 1.61 BCM is virtual-water export related to these 19 products, and the remaining 40.82 BCM is for internal use. Our results using satellite imagery show that in case of using all possible lands for agriculture, it would require 77.4 BCM. However, not all these lands are within human reach, and the maximum available water is way lower than this amount. Using satellite imagery, the total evaporation from agricultural lands shows 55.27 BCM for 2020, which agrees with national reports during 2005?2014. This study shows that agricultural water consumption tends to use internal water resources at a maximum level for export and national use, significantly impacting renewable and non-renewable water resource availability, especially in groundwater."

Colombia: A case study";"Diego Alejandro Riano-Herrera ? a , Diana Angelica Varela-Mart?ez b , Julien Gwendal Chenet a , Diego Armando Garc?-Garc? b , Sergio David D?z-Verus b , Leonardo Rodr?uez-Urrego c,d,";"The ongoing climate crisis, coupled with contemporary factors, starkly underscores the global vulnerability of food systems and the pressing need for adaptive approaches. Urban agriculture emerges as a multifaceted remedy for production, sustainability, and communal well-being. This study probes the role of small-scale organic urban agriculture in driving sustainable urban development through a focused case study. Essential markers of sustainable agro-production effectiveness take center stage. The research scrutinizes yield and productivity within a rooftop agri-food framework spanning eleven months. A collective of 336 vegetables were reaped, yielding an impressive 82.1% relative yield. Standout performers, including lettuce, arugula, and mizuna, achieved a relative yield of 4.1 kg/m2, comfortably situated within the 2.1?16 kg/m2 spectrum. This yield potential remains sensitive to intricate agronomic and environmental variables. The innovative potential extends to conferring food autonomy upon 11,553 families via 432 projects within Bogota. In conclusion, this research highlights the importance of small-scale organic urban agriculture as a viable approach to sustainable development in urban areas. The results contribute to the existing knowledge on yield and productivity indicators in sustainable agro-production systems, providing valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and public and private organizations."
231;Spatio-temporal characteristics of meteorological and agricultural drought indices and their dynamic relationships during the pre-monsoon season in drought-prone region of Bangladesh;"Baig Abdullah Al Shoumika , Md. Zulfikar Khanb,* , Md. Sanaul Islama";"The global water crisis has become a rising concern against the background of climate change, which is responsible for increasing drought frequency, a devastating natural hazard that severely affects the agricultural sector of a nation. Due to the geographical position, spatial variation in seasonal precipitation patterns, and groundwater table, the northwestern part of Bangladesh is one of the most drought-prone regions with extensive irrigation practices. In recent decades, the frequency of meteorological drought has significantly increased, but its dynamic relationship with agricultural drought is still unclear. In this research, we aim to study the meteorological and agricultural drought conditions and their dynamic relationships during the pre-monsoon season (March-May) in northwest Bangladesh. For this, we analyzed the 3-month standardized precipitation index (SPI), Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and 3-month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) to study the meteorological drought, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), and vegetation health index (VHI) using MODIS to study the agricultural drought. Results revealed that SPI-3 and SPEI-3 during the pre-monsoon increased, while PDSI decreased. Agricultural drought indices showed a better VHI status in 2021. The Pearson correlation among these indices represented no correlation between meteorological and agricultural drought. This research identified that the relationship between VHI and SPI-3 might not be positive in all cases, especially in extensively irrigated regions. Therefore, it is important to consider hydrological drought indices to improve the understanding and accuracy of drought assessment."
232;Impact of endogenous power factors and price marketization on agricultural energy efficiency: Based on the use of coal and oil energy in China;"Ming Zhang a,* , Panpan Du a , Lixia Jiang b";"In the face of the enormous challenge of climate change and environmental pollution, improving energy efficiency is currently the best option for achieving economic green recovery. Using generalized method of moments estimation of dynamic panel data models, we examined the effects of endogenous power factors (e.g., farmers? human capital, invention patents, and agricultural digitalization) on agricultural energy efficiency, as well as the moderating role of price marketization therein. The results show that farmers? human capital and agricultural invention patents cannot significantly improve agricultural energy efficiency, whereas agricultural digitalization promotes it obviously. Meanwhile, price marketization has played an important role in improving agricultural energy efficiency. Moreover, the higher the price marketization level, the more significant the role of endogenous power factors in improving agricultural energy efficiency."
233;Air pollution as a substantial threat to the improvement of agricultural total factor productivity: Global evidence;"Daxin Dong a,* , Jiaxin Wang b";"Objective: This study aims to provide empirical evidence about whether and to what extent air pollution affects the global agricultural total factor productivity (TFP). Methods: The research sample covers 146 countries all over the world during 2010?2019. Two-way fixed effects panel regression models are used to estimate air pollution?s impacts. A random forest analysis is conducted to assess the relative importance of independent variables. Results: The results show that, on average, a 1% increase in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and tropospheric ozone (O3) concentration would cause the agricultural TFP to decline by 0.104% and 0.207%, respectively. Air pollution?s adverse impact widely exists in various countries with different development levels, pollution degrees, and industrial structures. This study also finds that temperature has a moderating effect on the relationship between PM2.5 and agricultural TFP. PM2.5 pollution?s detrimental impact is weaker (stronger) in a warmer (cooler) climate. In addition, the random forest analysis confirms that air pollution is among the most crucial predictors of agricultural productivity. Conclusions: Air pollution is a substantial threat to the improvement of global agricultural TFP. Worldwide actions should be taken to ameliorate air quality, for the sake of agricultural sustainability and global food security."
234;Risk preferences and the low-carbon agricultural technology adoption: Evidence from rice production in China;"MAO Hui1 , QUAN Yu-rong1 , FU Yong2#";"Climate change which is mainly caused by carbon emissions is a global problem affecting the economic development and well-being of human society. Low-carbon agriculture is of particular significance in slowing down global warming and reaching the goal of ?carbon peak and carbon neutrality?. Therefore, taking straw incorporation as an example, this paper aims to investigate the impact of risk preferences on farmers? low-carbon agricultural technology (LCAT) adoption. Based on a two-phase micro-survey data of 1 038 rice farmers in Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, this paper uses experimental economics methods to measure farmers? risk aversion and loss aversion to obtain the real risk preferences information of the farmers. We also explore the data to examine the actual LCAT adoption behavior of farmers. The results revealed that both risk aversion and loss aversion significantly inhibit farmers? LCAT adoption: more risk-averse or more loss-averse farmers are less likely to adopt LCAT. It is further found that crop insurance, farm scale and governmental regulations can alleviate the negative impact of risk aversion and loss aversion on farmers? LCAT adoption. Therefore, we propose that local governments need to promote low-carbon agricultural development by propagating the benefits of LCAT, extending crop insurance, promoting appropriate scale operations, and strengthening governmental regulations to promote farmers? LCAT adoption."
235;Estimating the parcel-level impacts of agricultural conservation easements on farmland loss using satellite data in New England;"Kaitlyn Lee Malakoff a,* , Christoph Nolte b,c";"The rapid loss of farmland to development has long been a concern of policymakers and conservation non-profits globally. In the United States, agricultural conservation easements are a widespread policy tool used to protect farmland from conversion to development in perpetuity. However, the extent to which these easements reduce farmland loss to development within their boundaries is rarely studied at the spatial scale at which easement adoption decisions are made: the individual parcel. Our case study from six New England states uses a rich dataset of 1.97 million parcels, novel estimates of annual parcel-level land cover change from 1988 to 2016, and a quasi-experimental research design to estimate the extent to which 3959 farmland easements avoided conversion of cropland to development. We examine and discuss the suitability of remote sensing data and quasiexperimental matching methods for impact assessments in this geographic and political context. Our empirical results suggest that agricultural conservation easements have reduced farmland loss to development. The magnitude of avoided farmland loss is small (0.0067% ? 0.0019% of parcel area per annum), largely because of a low background rate of farmland loss across New England (0.0027% of total area per annum). Our findings suggest that the spatial allocation of farmland easements has historically not prioritized the highest-threat locations where impacts would be most noticeable, as allocation is driven by a diverse range of goals in addition to avoiding farmland loss."

Understanding the correlation between meteorological drought (MD) and agricultural drought (AD) is essential for relevant policymaking. In this paper, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index and standardized soil moisture index were used to estimate the MD and AD in the North China Plain (NCP) to identify the correlation between MD and AD during the growth period of winter wheat. In addition, we investigated the contributions of climate change (CC) and human activity (HA) to AD and the factors influencing the loss of winter wheat net primary production (NPP). Drought propagation time (PT) increased spatially from the southern to northern NCP (from 3 to 11 months). PT first increased and then decreased during the phenological period of winter wheat, and the decreasing trend was delayed with an increasing latitude. In general, the relative contribution of CC to AD was higher than that of HA the correlation between MD and AD exhibited a weakening trend, particularly during the middle and late phenological stages of winter wheat. Precipitation was the main driver of the effects of HA on AD the effects were stronger in areas with less precipitation. However, because of the improved irrigation conditions and scarce rainfall during the growth period of winter wheat in the study area, the effects of precipitation on AD were nonsignificant. Instead, temperature, wind, and total solar radiation, which are highly correlated with evapotranspiration, were identified as the primary drivers of AD spatiotemporal variations were noted in these correlations. Prolonged drought PT reduced NPP the sensitivity of winter wheat NPP to AD was higher in humid areas than in semiarid or semihumid areas. NPP loss occurred primarily due to HA. Our findings revealed a correlation between MD and AD in agroecosystems and may facilitate policymaking related to drought mitigation and food security."
237;"Dynamics of land cover transitions and agricultural abandonment in a mountainous agricultural landscape: Case of Ifugao rice terraces, Philippines";"Ian Estacio a,* , Mrittika Basu a , Corinthias P.M. Sianipar b , Kenichiro Onitsuka a , Satoshi Hoshino a";"Mountainous agricultural landscapes experienced large-scale land cover changes in the past decades due to traditional land modification practices and increasing permanent agricultural abandonment. However, there is lack of observation of short-period land cover transitions and paddy field dynamics of fallowing and recultivation. This study was implemented in the Philippines? Ifugao rice terraces with three aims. The first aim is to analyze rapid land cover transitions by mapping land cover maps in consistent five-year intervals from 1990 to 2020. The second aim is to analyze paddy field dynamics that involve permanent abandonment, fallowing, firsttime cultivations, and recultivation by developing an analysis framework involving time-series land cover maps. The third aim is to confirm the relationship between abundance of vegetation land covers and permanent abandonment of paddy fields by implementing regression analysis. Results show that a two-step process involving low vegetation as an intermediary land cover typically occurs in between agricultural abandonment and afforestation that was widely observed in mountainous agricultural landscapes. Observed temporal dynamics of paddy fields aligned with historical records such as high rates of permanent abandonment in the 1990s and recultivation (416% increase) in the 2000s. Regression analysis revealed that there is a significant correlation between low vegetation cover abundance and subsequent paddy field permanent abandonment (P = 0.0498), which confirms that afforestation in the landscape decreased the water yield and promoted agricultural abandonment. The findings suggest that planning of mountainous agricultural landscapes should address social and environmental driving factors to mitigate the land-transition feedback loop that further promotes agricultural abandonment."
238;Classification from Sky: A Robust Remote Sensing Time Series Image Classification Using Spatial Encoder and Multi-Fast Channel Attention;"Kwabena Sarpong a , Jehoiada Kofi Jackson a , Derrick Effah c , Daniel Addo a , Sophyani Banaamwini Yussif d , Mohammad Awrangjeb b , Rutherford Agbeshi Patamia a , Juliana Mantebea Danso a , Zhiguang Qin a,";"The unparalleled availability of Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) for crop phenology classification unravels agricultural parcel observation and monitoring with applications of both economic and ecological importance. Moreover, the need for distinct classification of agricultural parcels into individual crop types falls on state-of-the-art deep learning models for this extrinsic task. However, most existing approaches implemented are complex and ineffective attention incorporated models, which in turn lack the resilience to recognize useful bands in achieving greater accuracy. We propose a Multi-Fast Channel Attention module for deep CNNs based on a Spatial Encoder (SE-MFCA) that requires a few parameters while enhancing the performance-complexity trade-off dilemma. Hence, we leverage on spatial encoder module to extract the images as disorderly sets of pixels to enhance the coarse spatial resolution features. We empirically show that appropriate parameter sharing in the cross channel interaction can preserve performance while significantly reducing model complexity. The proposed multi-channel attention module can efficiently be implemented via an encoder-decoder network to prevent the loss of detailed spatial information. Again, we parallelly distributed the input channel into multiple heads in our network to recover the specialized input features, which will concatenate with the residual to form a rich single feature representation. The extensive experiment has shown that our model SE-MFCA is efficient and effective compared with the previous state-of-the-art time series classification algorithm on a publicly available dataset of Sentinel-2 images for agricultural parcels. Performance-wise SE-MFCA achieves the highest overall accuracy of 94.50% and the highest mean intersection over union score of 51.92%, besides the least trainable params of 131 K and fewer floating point operations of 0.16 M."
239;Fate of microplastics in sewage sludge and in agricultural soils;"Asta Hooge a, * , Henrik Hauggaard-Nielsen a , Wiebke M. Heinze b , Gry Lyngsie a , Tiffany M. Ramos a , Monica H. Sandgaard a , Jes Vollertsen c , Kristian Syberg a";"The aim of this study was to review microplastics (MPs) occurrence in sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and assess implications of sludge application to agricultural soils. Sludge is a main sink for MPs in WWTPs, highlighting the importance of sludge as a route for environmental exposure. Sludge application on agricultural fields is associated with elevated MP concentrations in soils, potentially affecting soil health. However, prior to application sludge treatments may alter MP abundance and MPs properties, such as shape and size, subsequently affecting environmental risk. Knowledge gaps still exist regarding sludge treatments and their effect on MPs (size, shape abundance). Further investigation is needed to assess the risk of MPs exposure at WWTPs, explore the effects of sludge treatments on soil health, and to better understand how management at WWTPs, and in agricultural systems, affect MP properties."
240;Multi-layer multi-objective cooperative regulation of agricultural water resources in large agricultural irrigation areas based on runoff prediction;"Mo Li a,b , Wuyuan Liu b , Qiang Fu a,b,* , Dong Liu a,b , Tianxiao Li a,b , Yaowen Xu b , Ruochen Shang b,c";"Reasonable and optimal allocation of irrigation water is of great significance to improve agricultural water use efficiency for large-area agricultural irrigation systems. To solve the problems of large agricultural production scale, unreasonable water distribution structure, many rivers in the region and large changes in runoff volume, this paper takes the Sanjiang Plain in Heilongjiang Province, China, as the research object to develop an efficient and accurate water optimal allocation method. First, the runoff volume of many rivers in the region was obtained through the ARIMA-SVM-BP combined runoff prediction model, based on which a ?regional-irrigation districtfarmland? multilayer multiobjective water resource cooperative deployment system model was established to achieve the synergistic enhancement of farmers? interests and the economic-social and regional economicengineering volume of the irrigation district. The joint optimization method, fuzzy mathematical planning, and large system decomposition-coordination coupling were used to solve the multilayer multiobjective regulation system. The results show that the optimal agricultural water allocation volumes for the current year (2020) and the forecast year (2025) of 37 irrigation districts in the Sanjiang Plain are 3.61 ? 109 m3 and 3.89 ? 109 m3 , saving 17% of water and resulting in a 24% decrease in the agricultural water use ratio compared with the actual situation, respectively. In the process of repeated coordination of the large system, the water distribution error is controlled within 1%. The fairness of water distribution in the multilayer system was improved by 34.7% while obtaining high economic benefits. The method proposed in this study helps the coordinated regulation and planning of multiple water sources in large agricultural irrigation areas, improves the ability of water distribution in irrigation areas to cope with different levels of incoming water, and promotes the sustainable development of regional irrigated agriculture."
241;Combining Sentinel-2 data with an optical-trapezoid approach to infer within-field soil moisture variability and monitor agricultural production stages;"Chunfeng Ma a,b,* , Kasper Johansen a , Matthew F. McCabe a";"Soil moisture is an important precision agricultural variable that can be used to identify optimal growth conditions, infer vegetation stress, and maximize crop yield. However, obtaining soil moisture information with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for such applications remains a challenge. The optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM), a shortwave infrared transformed reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index (STRNDVI) method, has previously been used for retrieving soil moisture from optical remote sensing data. However, the capacity of OPTRAM for mapping the high-resolution spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture at individual agricultural field scales has yet to be explored. Here, we advance an approach for retrieving and quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture for individual fields using high spatiotemporal resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. We also propose the concept of a dynamic STR-NDVI space for identification of irrigation events and crop growth stages, such as irrigation start and end dates, and dates of initial crop growth, maturity and harvest. Preexisting OPTRAM parameterization schemes were evaluated for several crops (maize, carrot, alfalfa and Rhodes grass) and a new scheme was proposed. Results show that the original OPTRAM model can derive surface soil moisture (~ 1 cm in depth) with acceptable coefficients of determination (R2 = 0.43) and root mean square errors (RMSE = 0.09 m3 /m3 ) against ground measurements when uniform dry and wet edge parameters are applied for all crop types. The proposed scheme produced improved soil moisture retrievals with an R2 = 0.65 and RMSE = 0.05 m3 /m3 when the specific dry and wet edge parameters were applied for each specific crop type. By analyzing time series of STR-NDVI, we demonstrate that the dynamic STR-NDVI spaces not only traces the coevolution of surface processes but also quantifies the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and vegetation status. Thus, the proposed dynamic STR-NDVI spaces based on the high spatiotemporal resolution Sentinel-2 imagery can both advance and extend the application of OPTRAM and improve the interpretation of soil moisture spatial heterogeneity at agricultural field scales, supporting efforts towards irrigation and crop growth monitoring in precision agriculture."
242;Small-scale mining and agriculture: Evidence from northwestern Tanzania;Adrian Poignant;"The rapid expansion of small-scale mining (ASM) in sub-Saharan Africa has raised significant concerns about its impact on the local economy. While ASM has the potential to raise incomes and mobilize investments, ultimately benefiting existing agricultural activities and livelihoods, it may also have adverse effects on local farming communities. This paper examines the impact of small-scale gold mining on the agricultural production decisions of 965 rural households in northwestern Tanzania between 2008 and 2012. Contrary to the expectation of positive investment spillovers from ASM to smallholder agriculture, I find that farmer households tend to allocate fewer resources to agriculture and produce less output when small-scale gold mining sites emerge nearby. However, I also find suggestive evidence that exposure to small-scale gold mining leads to an increase in household consumption, while producing no evidence of adverse schooling or child health effects. This implies that small-scale mining can play an important role in alleviating rural poverty in the short- to medium-run."

We discuss the advantages of this new instrumentation, various approaches to field data collection, and as well as our novel data processing and filtering methods, which collectively offer key methodological advances for archaeological investigations using drone-based lidar. Results reveal extensive remains of a vast system of terraces and stone-built field systems, preserved below the modern pinon-juniper- ? ponderosa forests of the Picuris Reservation and surrounding areas. These findings offer new perspectives on the scale and intensity of past agricultural activities in this highland region of the American Southwest, while demonstrating the power of combining multiple drone-based remote sensing datasets with detailed surface surveys to aid in the discovery, mapping, and interpretation of archaeological landscapes in forested regions."

Many earth observation satellites render information to monitor and assess agricultural burning activities. In this study, different remotely sensed data (Sentinel-2A, VIIRS) has been employed to estimate the quantitative measurements of agricultural burned areas of the Purba Bardhaman district from October?December 2018. The multi-temporal image differencing techniques and indices (NDVI, NBR, and dNBR) and VIIRS active fires data (VNP14IMGT) have been utilized to spot agricultural burned areas. In the case of the NDVI technique, a prominent area, 184.82 km2 of agricultural burned area (7.85% of the total agriculture), was observed. The highest (23.04 km2 ) burned area was observed in the Bhatar block, located in the middle part of the district, and the lowest (0.11 km2 ) burned area was observed in the Purbasthali-II block, which is located in the eastern part of the district. On the other hand, the dNBR technique revealed that the agricultural burned areas enwrap 8.18% of the total agricultural area, which is 192.45 km2 . As per the earlier NDVI technique, the highest agricultural burned areas (24.82 km2 ) were observed in the Bhatar block, and the lowest (0.13 km2 ) burn area occurred in the Purbashthali-II block. In both cases, it is observed that agricultural residue burning is high in the western part of the Satgachia block and the adjacent areas of the Bhatar block, which is in the middle part of Purba Bardhaman. The agricultural burned area was extracted using different spectral separability analyses, and the performance of dNBR was the most effective in spectral discrimination of burned and unburned surfaces. This study manifested that agricultural residue burning started in the central part of Purba Bardhaman. Later it spread all over the district due to the trend of early harvesting rice crops in this region. The performance of different indices for mapping the burned areas was evaluated and compared, revealing a strong correlation (R2) = 0.98. To estimate the campaign?s effectiveness against the dangerous practice and plan the control of the menace, regular monitoring of crop stubble burning using satellite data is required."
245;Application of machine learning techniques in the prediction of excess lifetime cancer risks of agricultural byproducts used as building and construction materials;"Solomon Oyebisia,? , Hilary Owamahb";"Recycling improves the circular economy and resource sustainability by using agricultural waste to create new products. However, agricultural byproducts resulting from the recycling of agricultural waste materials contain naturally occurring radionuclides with potential risks to human health and the environment. Therefore, this article provides an overview of relevant literature on radiological properties of agricultural byproducts (rice husk ash, mussel shell, palm oil clinker, and palm oil fuel ash), prioritizing their specific activities ( 226Ra, 232Th and 40K). Consequently, absorbed gamma dose rates (AGDR), annual effective dose rates (AEDR) and excess lifetime cancer risks (ELCR) of the agricultural byproducts studied were determined. The specific concentrations, AGDR, AEDR, and ECLR were trained, validated, and tested using various machine learning algorithms. An evaluation of the radiological properties of all agricultural byproducts examined revealed that they pose no risk of cancer. Additionally, compared to support vector machine, regression trees, ensemble trees, Gaussian process regression, and neural networks, linear regression yielded the best performance metrics, making it the most suitable technique for predicting excess lifetime cancer risks of the surveyed agricultural byproducts."
246;Pretreatment and composting technology of agricultural organic waste for sustainable agricultural development;"Peng Xu a , Luolin Shu a , Yang Li a , Shun Zhou a , Guanzhi Zhang a , Yongjun Wu b , Zhenchao Yang a,";"With the continuous development of agriculture, Agricultural organic waste (AOW) has become the most abundant renewable energy on earth, and it is a hot spot of research in recent years to realize the recycling of AOW to achieve sustainable development of agricultural production. However, lignocellulose, which is difficult to degrade in AOW, greenhouse gas emissions, and pile pathogenic fungi and insect eggs are the biggest obstacles to its return to land use. In response to the above problems researchers promote organic waste recycling by pretreating AOW, controlling composting conditions and adding other substances to achieve green return of AOW to the field and promote the development of agricultural production. This review summarizes the ways of organic waste treatment, factors affecting composting and problems in composting by researchers in recent years, with a view to providing research ideas for future related studies."
247;"How shifts in societal priorities link to reform in agricultural water management: Analytical framework and evidence from Germany, India and Tanzania";Chris Seijger;"Climate change, environmental awareness, and food security are just some of the new priorities societies pursue. Due to the very large influence of agriculture on water quantity and quality, often a certain degree of reform in agricultural water management is required to accommodate such new priorities. To assess the degree of reform an analytical framework is introduced to account for social (e.g. contestation, path dependency) and biophysical limitations (water balance as a zero-sum game, limited gains in biomass productivity) to reform in agricultural water management. The hypothesis tested in this paper is whether the framework is capable to link shifts in societal priorities to actual reform in agricultural water management and if the framework can assess to what extent agricultural water management has changed to accommodate shifting societal priorities. The analytical framework and variables assess ex-post the degree of a reorientation, which is understood as the interplay between shifts in societal priorities and reform in agricultural water management to accommodate such shifts. The framework offers a causal chain of 6 variables to assess a reorientation. A test is performed by probing the framework in diverse contexts of Germany, India and Tanzania. Evidence from Germany, India and Tanzania confirm the validity of the social and biophysical limitations as they acted as real boundaries for the amount of reform achieved. In Tanzania much reform was achieved and agricultural water management accommodated the new priority of agricultural expansion, whereas in Germany and India few farm-level changes were achieved making new priorities of environmental conservation unattainable. Based on the test it can be concluded that the framework offers a realistic lense to study reorientations around the world. For further research, indepth case studies are recommended to further develop the framework and advance insight in the complex biophysical and social interrelationships of reorientations."
248;Impacts of improved agricultural technology adoption on welfare in Africa: A meta-analysis;"Tsegaye Mulugeta Habtewold a,* , Almas Heshmati b";"A large body of researches have widely examined the impact of adopting improved agricultural practices and technologies on general welfare of smallholder farmers. The results of deep literature review show that varies agricultural technologies have significant impacts on different welfare measures identified in the primary studies. However, the estimated effects of technology adoption differ among studies. The current study presents a meta-analysis of empirical estimates using a sample of 52 studies that investigated the impact of improved agricultural technologies in Africa on three key sets of outcome variables: output or expenditure, food security, and poverty. The study also conducted tests for publication bias to see if researchers tend to report results in similar or different ways for the same outcome variable. The findings the study shed light on the ways of identifying potential factors explaining the differences in the effects of estimated technology adoption. Results of the meta-regression analysis revealed that differences in the reported impact of technologies is explained by factors like data type, model specification, sample size, region of the study, and journal type. It was also observed that no publication bias in the studies reviewed for the effect size measures of output (expenditure) and poverty models, but in the food security model there is some evidence of publication bias. One of the core implications of the current study is that, based on the sensitivity of effect sizes to study attributes (i.e. data type, econometric methods, sample size, region of the study, and journal type), interested researchers and academicians need to pay attention to these attributes to provide more reliable estimates for policy interventions. We believe this study provides information useful to interested decisionmakers in designing policy intervention measures that could encourage the adoption of improved agricultural practices and technologies in the African context. Finally, the study also highlighted future research directions."
249;Combining spectral analysis and geochemical tracers to investigate surface water?groundwater interactions: A case study in an intensive agricultural setting (southern Guatemala);"Ricardo Pa? a,* , Juan Francisco Low-Calle b , Amy Guicela Molina-Estrada b , Sergio Gil-Villalba b , Maria Teresa Condesso de Melo a";"An increase in the frequency of severe hydrological events has highlighted the importance of sustainable water management in intensive agricultural regions. In a warming climate, improved understanding and stewardship of water resources are needed to guarantee water supply, ensure food security, and build resilience against extreme events. In this study, we evaluate a framework that combines spectral analysis and geochemical tracers as a potential tool for (1) gaining valuable insights into surface water (SW)?groundwater (GW) interactions, and (2) providing guidance for improved water management in an intensive agricultural basin in southern Guatemala. The framework proves to be useful in revealing important water dynamics, exposing key feedback mechanisms for water availability and quality. With the use of power density functions and hydrochemistry (T, pH, EC, and major ions), two specific interaction regimes (influent and effluent) were identified and delimited for the main watercourse. These segments are estimated to interact at high rates with the shallow aquifer in the river channel proximities and would lose influence towards the basin flanks. Furthermore, the d2 H and d18O values indicate that regional groundwater flow systems play an essential role in the basin groundwater recharge. Lastly, we established three influence zones that depict the spatial extent of the SW-GW interactions within the basin. With these zones, we provide recommendations that will allow for further investigation and application into better water management strategies regulating groundwater development and land use activities within the agricultural context of the area."
250;The US-China trade war and the volatility linkages between energy and agricultural commodities;"Natalie Fang Ling Cheng a , Akram Shavkatovich Hasanov a,* , Wai Ching Poon b , Elie Bouri c";"Any disruptive changes in the competitive environment, such as the U.S.-China trade war, may influence the price volatility of crude oil and agricultural commodities. This study examines the volatility linkage between crude oil and agricultural commodity markets in the context of the U.S.-China trade war and compares the impact of the trade war with that of other exogenous shocks. The results show that the volatility of soybeans exhibits the highest level of responsiveness to the U.S.-China trade war - which is not surprising given that the U. S. agribusiness trade to China is dominated by soybeans - followed by coffee and cotton. The sizes and dynamics of the impacts of shocks are largely commodity-specific. Notably, the trade war impacts most agricultural commodities more extensively than other exogenous shocks, including the global financial crisis and the COVID19 pandemic and associated recession. These findings matter not only for the decision-making of investors and portfolio managers but also for commodity-exporting and importing countries because changes in the volatility dynamics of crude oil and agricultural commodities often impact export revenues and import expenditures and consequently feed through exports to the global supply chain under exogenous shocks such as the U.S.-China trade war."
251;Meat or mitigation? That?s the question: Storylines in the Norwegian agricultural policy discourse on meat reduction;"Jessica Larsson * , Jostein Vik";"Ruminant meat (beef and lamb) is recognised as the food with the largest environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet reducing meat consumption and production is controversial. Resistance to change has been linked to policy lock-ins and asymmetries in power favouring the agri-food industry. At the same time, agricultural policy has been described as moving towards a post-exceptional, less compartmentalized field where food production is balanced against issues like climate and animal welfare. In this article, we explore how the discourse on meat reduction and greenhouse gas emissions are related to various other agricultural policy issues, using Norway as a case. Investigating the stakeholder submissions to the Norwegian government?s ambitious proposal to reduce meat consumption and production in Climate Cure 2030, we identify three storylines in the discursive landscape. The first storyline is ?It is time to increase production ? not reduce it? which we see as an exceptionalist storyline where arguments for the unique position of the sector contributing to national goals of food security and value creation should prevail. Another dominant storyline is ?In our country, animal farming is sustainable?, which has typical post-exceptionalist features where nonproducer concerns, such as biodiversity and cultural landscapes, are seen as a net positive result of the grazing animals in Norway. The third storyline ?The voices of consumers, animals and nature need to be included in policy networks? also has strong post-exceptionalist viewpoints, but it calls for a radical restructuring of the sector, therefore, we see this as a radical postexceptionalism. Our findings find little support for radical change, and for now, meat beats mitigation."
252;Barriers to the adoption of new technologies in rural areas: The case of unmanned aerial vehicles for precision agriculture in India;"Harish Puppala a , Pranav R.T. Peddinti b,c , Jagannadha Pawan Tamvada d,* , Jaya Ahuja e , Byungmin Kim b";"Technological advances can significantly transform agrarian rural areas by increasing productivity and efficiency while reducing labour intensive processes. For instance, the usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can offer flexibility collecting real-time information of the crops enabling farmers to take timely decisions. However, little is known about the barriers to the adoption of such technologies by rural farmers in emerging economies like India. Building on an extensive literature review, focussed group discussions, and field visits, the barriers impacting the adoption are identified and classified into technical, social, behavioural, operational, economic, and implementation categories. The relevance of each barrier and its importance is evaluated using a hybrid multi-criteria framework built on the theory of Fuzzy Delphi and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process to identify the most crucial barriers to the adoption of UAVs to implement precision agriculture in rural India. The paper suggests new avenues for accelerating technology adoption in rural areas of emerging economies."
253;Climate change and its impacts on Vietnam agriculture: A macroeconomic perspective;"Dao Le Trang Anh a,* , Nguyen Tuan Anh b , Abbas Ali Chandio c";"Vietnam is an important contributor to the world?s food industry as a major exporter of rice, seafood, and coffee. Climate change poses a serious threat to Vietnam?s agricultural sector since it adversely affects food security in Vietnam and globally. This study investigates the short- and long-term effects of climate change on Vietnam?s agriculture, both in terms of production and values at the macro level. Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and the Toda-Yamamoto (1995) Granger causality test with annual data from 1990 to 2019, we confirm the detrimental impacts of global warming on Vietnam?s agricultural performance in both the short and long term. We also reveal the favorable effects of CO2 emissions, land, and fertilizer on Vietnam?s agricultural production and economics. Other factors, including rainfall and labor, however, adversely affect Vietnam?s agricultural output and economic performance. Based on the study?s results, we provide policy recommendations to assist the government limit the negative effects of climate change on the national economy, thereby promoting poverty alleviation and sustainable development in Vietnam."
254;Biosensor for agriculture and food safety: Recent advances and future perspectives;"Xin Wang a , Yunbo Luo a,b , Kunlun Huang a,b,**, Nan Cheng a,b,*";"Climate change and the growing world population leading to agriculture and food safety are global challenges facing humanity, while biosensors have long been regarded as one of the powerful tools for providing solutions. Biosensors can aid in sustainable agriculture by providing continuous monitoring or early detection of disease outbreaks that can be averted. It also plays an important role in monitoring food risk factors such as pesticides, veterinary medications, heavy metals, pathogens, poisons, and illegal additions. Currently, this field includes a series of reviews covering the topic, but surprisingly, there tend to focus more on a single level and ignore the role across the food value chain. In this Perspective, we emphasized on the importance of all sectors from farm to fork for developing better biosensors."
255;Agricultural process data as a source for knowledge: Perspective on artificial intelligence;"Juha Backman * , Markku Koistinen, Ari Ronkainen";"In visions of the future of agriculture, it is predicted that Artificial Intelligence and Robotics will revolutionize farming. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not always clearly visible to the end users, who are in this case farmers. AI methods are usually incorporated in existing Farm Management Information Systems or in some cases in separate Decision Support Systems or the AI is part of the machine or robot operation. Currently, AI methods are used mostly in machine vision applications. Practical applications that use methods other than image data are scarce. However, agricultural machines produce an ever-increasing amount of process data during agricultural operations. There is huge potential to gain useful information from this data. This paper presents a case example of treatment-zone determination based on agricultural process data using clustering methods. This paper also describes how AI is incorporated into the Cropinfra research data collection platform. Based on the experiences gained from Cropinfra-related research projects and a review of research papers, we predict the future directions of Artificial Intelligence in agriculture."
256;Mapping irrigated agriculture in fragmented landscapes of sub-Saharan Africa: An examination of algorithm and composite length effectiveness;"Timon Weitkamp a,b,* , Gert Jan Veldwisch b , Poolad Karimi c , Charlotte de Fraiture c";"Accurately identifying irrigated areas is crucial for sustainable development, food security, and effective land and water resource management. However, incomplete or outdated national estimates of irrigated areas underestimate the extent of it, particularly among smallholders. This study aimed to address this issue by investigating the impact of different algorithms and composite lengths on predicting irrigated agriculture in four study areas in Mozambique. The study found that the choice of algorithm and composite length notably impacted the accuracy of identifying irrigation. Shorter composite lengths, such as 2-monthly or 3-monthly composites, were more effective in identifying irrigation in fragmented and dynamic landscapes, while longer composite lengths were better suited to stable classes and homogeneous landscapes. Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests were all effective algorithms for classifying irrigation. However, the study emphasised the importance of considering hotspots and agreement maps when identifying irrigation. Agreement maps combine the classification results of multiple models, providing better insights into the core areas of irrigated agriculture and allowing for a better understanding of irrigation dynamics and policy decision-making, particularly among smallholder systems. This research provides valuable insights for those working on remote sensing-based irrigation mapping and monitoring in sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on identifying smallholder irrigation with greater certainty."
257;"Reduction pathways identification of agricultural water pollution in Hubei Province, China";"Weijun He a , Ke Zhang a , Yang Kong a,b,* , Liang Yuan a , Qingling Peng b , Dagmawi Mulugeta Degefu c , Thomas Stephen Ramsey a , Xu Meng a";"The differentiated management of agricultural water pollution plays a significant role in alleviating water quality crisis, which is an important factor to guarantee sustainable water use and agriculture. The key is to accurately identify the differentiated pathways to reduce water pollution due to agricultural activities. Taking Hubei Province as a case study, this study comprehensively explored the actual spatial?temporal characteristics and main influencing factors of agricultural grey water footprint (AGWF) for the time period from 2010 to 2019 at the provincial and municipal levels by creatively combining the Dagum Gini coefficient, Moran?s I index and Generalized Divisia Index Method (GDIM). On the basis, the Tapio decoupling model was used to examine the status quo of AGWF reduction in the context of economic development and to classify the two-dimensional decoupling state between AGWF and agricultural GDP (AGDP), aiming at guiding the implementation of zoning management. The analysis yield four significant results: (1) Compared with 2010, the AGWF of Hubei Province in 2019 has achieved negative growth both at the provincial and municipal levels. The AGWF of Hubei Province and its 17 prefecture-level cities presented a trend of first rising and then declining. On the whole, AGWF was positively correlated with AGDP at the municipal level. (2) During the whole study period, the difference in AGWFs of 17 subregions in Hubei Province basically remained in a ?relatively unbalanced? state. There was no significant spatial dependence among the subregions on the whole. (3) AGDP and permanent resident population were the main promoting factors of AGWF increase, while AGWF intensity, AGDP per capita and agricultural water use (AWU) intensity were the main inhibiting factors. Among them, AGDP and AGWF intensity respectively played the largest promoting and inhibiting effects on the increase of AGWF. (4) AGWF and AGDP of 17 prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province have all achieved strong decoupling, indicating that AGWFs in these regions have achieved both quantity and efficiency control. These cities were divided into different categories and given differentiated zoning management measures. This study puts forward a complete analytical framework for differentiated zoning management of regional agricultural water pollution. The research findings of this paper can provide important policy implications for other cases as well."
258;Measuring the agricultural sustainability of India: An application of pressure-state-response model;"Surendra Singh Jatav a,* , Kalu Naik b";"Analyzing agricultural sustainability is essential for designing and assessing rural development initiatives. However, accurately measuring agricultural sustainability is complicated since it involves so many different factors. This study provides a new suite of quantitative indicators for assessing agricultural sustainability at regional and district levels, involving environmental sustainability, social security, and economic security. Combining the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model and indicator approach, this study creates a composite agricultural sustainability index for the 14 mainstream agro-climatic regions of India. The results of this study show that the TransGengatic Plain Region (TGPR) ranks first in agricultural sustainability among India?s 14 mainstream agro-climatic regions, while the Eastern Himalayan Region (EHR) ranks last. Higher livestock ownership, cropping intensity, per capita income, irrigation intensity, share of institutional credit, food grain productivity, crop diversification, awareness of minimum support price, knowledge sharing with fellow farmers, and young and working population, as well as better transportation facilities and membership of agricultural credit societies are influencing indicators responsible for higher agricultural sustainability in TGPR compared with EHR. Although, the scores of environmental sustainability indicators of EHR are quite good, its scores of social and economic security indicators are fairly low, putting it at the bottom of the rank of agricultural sustainability index among the 14 mainstream agro-climatic regions in India. This demonstrates the need of understanding agricultural sustainability in relation to social and economic dimensions. In a nation as diverse and complicated as India, it is the social structure that determines the health of the economy and environment. Last but not least, the sustainability assessment methodology may be used in a variety of India?s agro-climatic regions."
259;Twenty years of nitrous oxide emissions research in Australian agriculture: A review;"Alison M. Laing a,* , Richard J. Eckard b , Andrew P. Smith b , Peter Grace c";"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent and long-lived greenhouse gas, significant anthropogenic emissions of which are from agriculture. We reviewed 20 years? (2001?2020) of published N2O emissions measurements from Australian agriculture with the aim of summarising measured data at a sectoral and/or regional level to develop recommendations for policymakers and farmer support groups. We found that over the 20-year period N2O emissions were recorded with a range of collection methods, experimental duration and intent, and units of emission. While the lack of consistency or strategic planning is understandable given the diverse funding sources and aims of the short-term research projects through which measurement data were collected, it impeded the development of recommendations to mitigate agricultural N2O emissions. Australia has a diverse and heterogenous agricultural landscape and while there are relatively few emissions measurements relative to most other countries the national N2O dataset is large: globally-relevant methods to reliably estimate regional-scale N2O emissions are required. Developing targeted long-term monitoring sites to inform the estimation of sector-level N2O emissions is critical to inform producers and policymakers of national, regional or sector-level emissions reduction strategies in countries where agriculture is a key source of greenhouse gas emissions."
260;Time Preferences and green agricultural technology adoption: Field evidence from rice farmers in China;"Hui Mao a , Li Zhou b,* , RuiYao Ying b , Dan Pan c";"Green agricultural technology has the potential to not only alleviate the degradation of soil fertility, but also to improve the agricultural productivity of smallholders. In this paper, taking straw incorporation as an example, experiments were conducted in Chinese villages to directly measure the time preferences of farmers, and an attempt was made to evaluate the contribution of time preferences to farmers? technology adoption behavior. Furthermore, this research aims to assess the moderating role of production scale between the farmer?s time preferences and technology adoption. This study is a continuation of previous studies on factors influencing green agricultural technology adoption. The results show that time preferences significantly reduce technology adoption in particular, farmers who are more present-biased have a lower proportion of technology adoption. This is because farmers with lower discount rates are more sensitive to future income. Further analysis indicates that compared with small-scale farmers, large-scale farmers are more likely to adopt green technology. It is posited that this occurs because large-scale farmers will gain more benefits by adopting green agricultural technology, and thus, they will be more sensitive to high profits in the future. Moreover, the increase of production scale can reduce the inhibitory effect of time preferences on farmers? technology adoption, which means that scale economies play a moderating role between the farmer?s time preferences and their technology adoption. Overall, this research provides a micro foundation and policy recommendations for green agricultural technology promotion and sheds light upon how the government can formulate relevant policies to promote green agricultural development."
261;"An examination of thematic research, development, and trends in remote sensing applied to conservation agriculture";"Zobaer Ahmed a, b, * , Aaron Shew c , Lawton Nalley c , Michael Popp c , V. Steven Green d, e , Kristofor Brye f";"Conservation agriculture seeks to reduce environmental degradation through sustainable management of agricultural land. Since the 1990s, agricultural research has been conducted using remote sensing technologies however, few previous reviews have been conducted focused on different conservation management practices. Most of the previous literature has focused on the application of remote sensing in agriculture without focusing exclusively on conservation practices, with some only providing a narrative review, others using biophysical remote sensing for quantitative estimates of the bio-geochemical-physical properties of soils and crops, and few others focused on single agricultural management practices. This paper used the preferred reporting items for systematic review (PRISMA) methodology to examine the last 30 years of thematic research, development, and trends associated with remote sensing technologies and methods applied to conservation agriculture research at various spatial and temporal scales. A set of predefined key concepts and keywords were applied in three databases: Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. A total of 188 articles were compiled for initial examination, where 68 articles were selected for final analysis and grouped into cover crops, crop residue, crop rotation, mulching, and tillage practices. Publications on conservation agriculture research using remote sensing have been increasing since 1991 and peaked at 10 publications in 2020. Among the 68 articles, 94% used a pixel-based, while only 6% used an object-based classification method. Prior to 2005, tillage practices were abundantly studied, then crop residue was a focused theme between 2004 and 2012. From 2012 to 2020, the focus shifted again to cover crops. Ten spectral indices were used in 76% of the 68 studies. This examination offered a summary of the new potential and identifies crucial future research needs and directions that could improve the contribution of remote sensing to the provision of long-term operational services for various conservation agriculture applications."
262;Emerging trends in the appliance of ultrasonic technology for valorization of agricultural residue into versatile products;"Fatimah Athiyah Sabaruddin a , Liana Noor Megashah a , Siti Shazra Shazleen a , Hidayah Ariffin a,b,";"The utilization of agricultural residues to obtain biocompounds of high-added value has significantly increased in the past decades. The conversion of agro-based residues into valuable products appears to be an economically efficient, environment-friendly, and protracted waste management practice. The implementation of ultrasonic technologies in the conversion of value-added goods from agricultural waste materials through pre-treatment and valorization processes has imparted many advantageous effects including rapid processing, effective process performance, minimization of processing steps, minimal dependency on harmful chemicals, and an increased yield and properties of bio-products. To further enliven the literature and inspire new research investigations, this review covers the comprehensive work including theoretical principles, processes, and potential benefits of ultrasonic treatment technologies to assist the production of bio-products which emphasize the extraction yield and the characteristic of the end-product extracted from agriculture residues. A detailed evaluation of these methods and key aspects impacting their performance as well as the features and shortcomings of each ultrasound-assisted approach is also discussed. This review also addressed some of the challenges associated with using ultrasonic irradiation and proposed several potential techniques to maximize productivity. Understanding the concept of ultrasonication technique allow the academician and industrial practitioners to explore the possibility of applying a greener and sustainable approach of biomass extraction to be translated into higher scale production of commercial products."
263;Making technological innovations accessible to agricultural water management: Design of a low-cost wireless sensor network for drip irrigation monitoring in Tunisia;"Paul Vandome ? a,* , Crystele Leauthaud a , Simon Moinard b , Oliver Sainlez a , Insaf Mekki c , Abdelaziz Zairi c , Gilles Belaud a";"Unsustainable use of water resources and climate change will exacerbate the existing tensions surrounding resources, especially in the Mediterranean context. Despite investments in costly modern equipment, the performance of irrigated agriculture remains below expectations, notably because of the lack of available water data and the limited use of decision support tools. Although a variety of soil moisture sensors are available on the market, they are not widely used by the agricultural community because of their high cost and complexity. Access to information at an unprecedented level, via easily accessible low-cost and low-tech sensors, may be a major lever for improved identification of achievable gains in performance, and to guide actors toward efficient water management. To explore this hypothesis, an open source wireless soil moisture sensor, low-energy and economically and technically accessible, was developed. The tool was designed according to water users? requirements and applied to a Tunisian irrigation scheme subject to major water use efficiency issues. The functioning of the wireless sensor network was tested on pilot plots over a growing season and compared with commercial sensors. A single parameter calibration can be performed in either the laboratory or the field. This low-cost sensor can be used for real-time irrigation monitoring and as a decision-making tool for water management."
264;Long-term water quality monitoring in agricultural catchments in Sweden: Impact of climatic drivers on diffuse nutrient loads;"G. Ezzati ? , K. Kyllmar, J. Barron";"Water quality related to non-point source pollution continues to pose challenges in agricultural landscapes, despite two completed cycles of Water Framework Directive actions by farmers and landowners. Future climate projections will cause new challenges in landscape hydrology and subsequently, the potential responses in water quality. Investigating the nutrient trends in surface waters and studying the efficiency of mitigation measures revealed that loads and measures are highly variable both spatially and temporally in catchments with different agro-climatic and environmental conditions. In Sweden, nitrogen and phosphorus loads in eight agricultural catchments (470?3300 ha) have been intensively monitored for >20 years. This study investigated the relationship between precipitation, air temperature, and discharge patterns in relation to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads at catchment outlets. The time series data analysis was carried out by integrating Mann-Kendall test, Pettitt break-points, and Generalized Additive Model. The results showed that the nutrient loads highly depend on water discharge, which had large variation in annual average (158?441 mm yr-1 ). The annual average loads were also considerably different among the catchments with total N (TN) loads ranging from 6.76 to 35.73 kg ha-1 , and total P (TP) loads ranging from 0.11 to 1.04 kg ha-1 . The climatic drivers were highly significant indicators of nutrient loads but with varying degree of significance. Precipitation (28?962 mm yr-1 ) was a significant indicator of TN loads in five catchments (loamy sand/sandy loam) while annual average temperature (6.5?8.7 ?C yr-1 ) was a significant driver of TN loads in six out of eight catchments. TP loads were associated with precipitation in two catchments and significantly correlated to water discharge in six catchments. Considering the more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events, it is necessary to tailor N and P mitigation measures to future climate-change features of precipitation, temperature, and discharge."
265;Biodiversity measures providing food and nesting habitat increase the number of bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies in modelled agricultural landscapes;"Franziska Baden-Bohm ? a,b,* , Jens Dauber a,b , Jan Thiele a,b";"Individual biodiversity measures in agricultural landscapes such as flower strips are reported to promote the diversity and abundance of pollinating insects. Those biodiversity measures can be important food sources increasing the amount and continuity of pollen and nectar supply besides sometimes also offering nesting and hibernation sites. Still little is known about combined effects of biodiversity measures at the landscape scale and their long-term impact on pollinator population development. We used the agent-based simulation model BumbleBEEHAVE to investigate, if biodiversity measures have a positive effect on bumblebee populations at landscape scale in terms of the number of colonies per hectare. For this purpose, we chose Bombus terrestris, the most common bumblebee species in Germany, as target species. We used three real landscapes located in different regions of Germany as landscape settings for the simulations. The landscapes had strongly different farming systems regarding crop diversity and rotations and, consequently, different spatial structure and areal proportions of land-use types and semi-natural habitats. Between 2017 and 2020, distinct combinations of biodiversity measures, such as flower strips, flowering headland and fallows, were established by farmers on different areal proportions of the three landscapes. The biodiversity measures differed in plant-seed mixtures and, thus, the pollen and nectar supply by plants. We simulated the development of bumblebee colonies in the landscapes with and without the implemented biodiversity measures over eight years (four years in a twice repetition). We found that the implementation of biodiversity measures had a significant positive effect on the number of colonies. Further analysis showed that the pollen and nectar supplied by biodiversity measures had positive effects in all three landscapes, while the effect of additional nesting habitat differed among landscapes. Mass-flowering crops had little to no significant effect on the number of bumblebee colonies, whereas seminatural habitats had a markedly positive effect. Our study underlines that not only biodiversity measures are likely to affect the bumblebee population, but that the overall landscape composition, particularly proportion of semi-natural habitats, is also important. So, to achieve high effectiveness of biodiversity measures, landscape context may be taken into account."

In this paper, taking the Huaihai Economic Zone (HEZ) as a case study area, we used a series of geospatial models and multisource data to construct a framework for assessing the production-living-ecology of agricultural ecosystem services. Then, the ecosystem services and comprehensive production-living-ecology index of the cropland in the entire study area were evaluated and analyzed. Finally, we used a method of regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning to identify the subclusters of agricultural ecosystems in the study area and proposed the concept of regional management. We found that (1) for the single service of agricultural ecosystems, based on warm temperate semihumid climatic conditions and topographic factors, water conservation, carbon sequestration and oxygen release and grain production services in the HEZ showed spatial consistency in 2017 the distribution characteristics of these factors were high in the south and low in the north the distribution of soil maintenance services was the opposite, and the high value of culture and recreation services was scattered and distributed in areas with good ecological background conditions and convenient transportation. (2) The production-living-ecology index in the HEZ generally showed a distribution pattern of high in the south and low in the north. (3) Through zoning, the 1884 grids, 12 partitions, and 6 subclusters provide references for the management of different types of agricultural ecosystem services. Our results can provide scientific guidance for the development of effective agricultural ecosystem management programs and the optimization of cropland development."
267;Empowering women through targeting information or role models: Evidence from an experiment in agricultural extension in Uganda;"Els Lecoutere a , David J. Spielman b , Bjorn Van Campenhout c,?";"Agricultural advisory services are generally biased towards men, with information targeted mainly to male members within the household, and in formats that often reinforce male dominance in agricultural decision-making. Such biases affect women?s ability to make informed decisions and limit their intrahousehold bargaining power. Because women?s empowerment in agriculture has many wellestablished benefits, designing inclusive agricultural extension and advisory services is important. In this study, we challenge the assumption that information is fully shared between co-heads of a household. We also test if portraying women as equally able farmers challenges gender norms and stereotypes in agriculture. We do this through a field experiment in eastern Uganda in which videos that provide information on recommended maize-farming practices are shown to monogamous maize-farming households. In the experiment, we manipulate who within the household is exposed to the information contained in the video. Furthermore, we vary the gender of the person delivering the information in the video. We find that targeting the female co-head alone with information increases her knowledge about recommended practices, her role in agricultural decision-making, her subsequent adoption of recommended practices and inputs, and yields on fields she manages, while the male co-head?s knowledge about the practices and his unilateral decision-making is reduced. When both co-heads are targeted, joint adoption of recommended practices and inputs increases, while the male co-head?s unilateral decisionmaking is reduced. We find some support that featuring female role models in the videos challenges men?s beliefs and stereotypes about women?s roles in agriculture, and encourages adoption of recommended practices by women. We conclude that if the aim is to empower women, most gains can be made by re-designing advisory services to target information exclusively to the female co-head within the household. Challenging gender stereotypes may create room for increasing women?s involvement in agriculture"
268;Spatiotemporal characteristics of agricultural droughts based on soil moisture data in Inner Mongolia from 1981 to 2019;"Shuohao Cai a,b , Xiaoning Song a,b,* , Ronghai Hu a,b , Pei Leng c , Xiaotao Li d , Da Guo a,b , Ya?nan Zhang a,b , Yanbin Hao b,e , Yanfen Wang a,b";"As the critical parameter of the agricultural drought process, soil moisture (SM) has the potential to monitor agricultural drought, which can provide practical support for water management. In this study, a drought index, namely Soil Dryness Index (SDI), was proposed based on long-term gridded ERA-5 land SM, and its performance was evaluated. Furthermore, we employed the run theory and copula to study the spatiotemporal drought characteristics based on this index in Inner Mongolia. Although the return period of drought events has been assessed in many studies, the drought tends to occur with a nonstationary frequency. The wavelet transform was then applied to drought area proportion time series in sub-regions to study the temporal characteristics of droughts. The results show that SDI performs well in monitoring agricultural drought. There is strong heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of drought events. Frequent and low-severity droughts dominated arid and semi-arid regions, while some high-severity droughts mainly occurred in humid and semi-humid regions (mainly in Hulunbuir and Xing?an). The droughts, especially those with high severity, have become much more frequent in the last two decades. The period from 2000 to 2010 had seen more frequent droughts in recent 40 years, and most 20-year return period droughts occurred during this period. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of agricultural droughts and provide a reference for future drought trends in Inner Mongolia."
269;Vision-based navigation and guidance for agricultural autonomous vehicles and robots: A review;"Yuhao Bai a , Baohua Zhang b,* , Naimin Xu a , Jun Zhou a , Jiayou Shi a , Zhihua Diao c";"Autonomous navigation of agricultural robots and vehicles in agricultural environments is a prerequisite for the accomplishment of various tasks. However, precision navigation of agricultural robots is still a challenging issue due to the complex and unstructured nature of the agricultural environment. With the development of electronics and information technology, machine vision technology has become a promising tool for real-time and accurate navigation of agricultural robots. Due to low hardware cost and rich visual information, machine vision technology has been intensively studied and widely used in the field of autonomous navigation agricultural robots. Aiming at the special complexity of agricultural environment, this paper reviews the research advances of agricultural autonomous vehicle and robot navigation and guidance based on machine vision.

270;An update of the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall erosivity (R-factor) for the main agricultural production zones of Austria;"Lisbeth L. Johannsen a,* , Elmar M. Schmaltz a , Olivia Mitrovits a , Andreas Klik b , Wolfgang Smoliner b , Shengping Wang c , Peter Strauss a";"Rainfall erosivity is one of the key parameters influencing the degree of soil erosion. Due to the high spatiotemporal variability of rainfall erosivity and the influence of a changing climate it is crucial to use spatially welldistributed and temporally current rainfall data. Rainfall erosivity in Austria has been estimated by previous studies with varying rainfall data amounts. This study aimed to create an updated R-factor map for Austria and its main agricultural production zones based on a larger number of rainfall stations and a recent time series. As well as, compare R-factors from previous studies to identify differences in erosivity estimation. Rainfall data from 171 stations throughout Austria were gap-filled and corrected to improve data quality. Rainfall erosivity was calculated for 1995?2015 for the vegetation period and annually and used to establish two linear regressions describing rainfall erosivity as a function of mean rainfall amount. The regressions were applied to the 1 km2 daily rainfall grids from the SPARTACUS dataset to create the spatially distributed rainfall erosivity maps. Differences in the temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity, erosion index and erosivity density between the main agricultural production zones showed areas at risk of soil erosion and timing of vulnerability. The highest rainfall erosivities were found in the agriculturally important eastern regions of Austria during the summer months. Compared to previous studies, considerable differences in local R-factor estimation were found. The significantly larger number of rainfall stations and an updated time series increased the representativeness of rainfall erosivity estimation in Austria, which can contribute to a more precise soil erosion risk assessment."
271;Study of convolutional neural network-based semantic segmentation methods on edge intelligence devices for field agricultural robot navigation line extraction;"Jiya Yu a , Jiye Zhang a , Aijing Shu a , Yujie Chen a , Jianneng Chen b , Yongjie Yang c , Wei Tang c , Yanchao Zhang a,";"Smart agricultural machinery is emerging as the future trend for field robots, and the fully automatic robot has a great application prospect. However, it is a big challenge for robots to navigate in complex farmland environments. In this research, 5 deep learning-based computer vision methods under different field scenes for field navigation line extraction were studied and successfully deployed on an embedded system, which can be integrated into robots for automatic navigation in the future. The field road was segmented by the semantic segmentation algorithm at first, and then the navigation line is extracted from the segmented image by a polygon fitting method. Finally, all the models are transformed through the TensorRT library and deployed on the edge computing device Jetson Nano. In the experiment, five reprehensive semantic segmentation networks namely UNet, Deeplabv3+, BiseNetv1, BiseNetv2, and ENet networks were selected. Among the five networks, Deeplabv3+ is the most accurate. In five scenes, its average segmentation accuracy is 84.87 %, and the navigation line error is 9.59 pixels. Especially in the third scene with shadow and occlusion, it performs best, with only 8.34 pixel error, But the speed of Deeplabv3+ is only 9.7 FPS. ENet, BiseNetv1, and BiseNetv2 are lightweight networks. The speed of ENet is 16.8 FPS, BiseNetv2 is 17 FPS, and BiseNetv1 is 15.8 FPS. In segmentation accuracy and navigation line error, ENet performs better than BiseNet series networks, which are 84.94 % and 10.73 pixels, respectively. In the third scene with shadow and occlusion, it also performs slightly better than BiseNet series networks. In summary, deep learning-based semantic segmentation methods have strong robustness and stability in complex environment compared with previous research. Among all currently available neural networks, ENet has the best performance and good application potential in field navigation."
272;Smart agriculture and digital twins: Applications and challenges in a vision of sustainability;"Stefano Cesco a , Paolo Sambo b , Maurizio Borin b , Bruno Basso c , Guido Orzes a,d,* , Fabrizio Mazzetto a,d";"Smart agriculture ? i.e., the increasing use of information technologies, sensors, autonomous vehicles, data analytics, predictive modelling, and other digital technologies related to agricultural activities ? has been strongly argued for as a means to significantly contribute to increased food security, reduced water consumption, reduced fertilizer and pesticide input, and increased farm profitability. Despite this, the adoption rate of smart agricultural technologies is still low and varies significantly according to the specific technology and the geographical area considered. The goals of this paper are to: (1) propose a conceptual framework for smart agriculture and digital twins, which takes into account the needs and characteristics of the farms (2) present the application of the proposed conceptual framework as a case study and (3) shed light on the challenges of and the future perspectives on smart agriculture. We first propose a framework for the design of farm information systems consisting of four key phases (i.e., data collection, data processing, data analysis and evaluation, and information use) based on the infological approach. We then apply the framework to present and discuss a field application of smart agriculture and digital twins on crop nitrogen (N) fertilization. The case study, along with the cited literature, highlights the need to specify the optimal N fertilizer input as well as defining the spatial variability of the land area, the soil characteristics and crop yield, and the integration of these with temporal variability. Finally, we discuss challenges and future perspectives, with particular focus on geographical areas characterized by small average farm size. We argue that, thanks to digital twins, the wide set of data collected can enable predictive (and stability) analyses that if implemented can benefit the farmer and the environmental, social, and economic sustainability of the agricultural system."
273;National high-resolution cropland classification of Japan with agricultural census information and multi-temporal multi-modality datasets;"Junshi Xia a,* , Naoto Yokoya b,a , Bruno Adriano a , Keiichiro Kanemoto c";"Multi-modality datasets offer advantages for processing frameworks with complementary information, particularly for large-scale cropland mapping. Extensive training datasets are required to train machine learning algorithms, which can be challenging to obtain. To alleviate the limitations, we extract the training samples from the agricultural census information. We focus on Japan and demonstrate how agricultural census data in 2015 can map different crop types for the entire country. Due to the lack of Sentinel-2 datasets in 2015, this study utilized Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 collected across Japan and combined observations into composites for different prefecture periods (monthly, bimonthly, seasonal). Recent deep learning techniques have been investigated the performance of the samples from agricultural census information. Finally, we obtain nine crop types on a countrywide scale (around 31 million parcels) and compare our results to those obtained from agricultural census testing samples as well as those obtained from recent land cover products in Japan. The generated map accurately represents the distribution of crop types across Japan and achieves an overall accuracy of 87% for nine classes in 47 prefectures. Our findings highlight the importance of using multimodality data with agricultural census information to evaluate agricultural productivity in Japan. T"
274;The coupling and coordination between food production security and agricultural ecological protection in main food-producing areas of China;"Linqi Liu , Xinyue Wang * , Xuanzhu Meng , Yingying Cai";"Food production security (FPS) and agricultural ecological protection (AEP) are both among the paramount issues affecting the country. There are multiple nonlinear interactions between the two systems, while fewer studies have focused on the interaction patterns between them. To realize China?s national strategic goals of food security and ecological protection, the interaction between FPS and AEP needs to be analyzed. Based on the evaluation index system of the coupling and coordination between the two systems, this article analyzes the spatio-temporal differentiation and influencing factors in 13 main food-producing regions in China from 2009 to 2021 using the state-space method and spatial econometric model. The following three conclusions were found: First, the overall development levels of both FPS and AEP show an increasing trend, but regional differences are obvious. Second, the coupling coordination degree and stage of the two systems present an upward trend, but the overall development level remains low, with obvious regional differences: Liaoning is still on the imminent disorder stage, while Heilongjiang has taken the lead into the intermediate coordination stage. Third, the total power of grain machinery and the soybean corn planting ratio have a significant positive impact on the coupling and coordination between FPS and AEP. The results make up for the lack of research on coupling and coordination between FPS and AEP, and provide a feasible development path for exploring coordinated development of FPS and AEP in China?s main food-producing areas."
275;MADIA - Meteorological variables for agriculture: A dataset for the Italian area;"Barbara Parisse* , Roberta Alilla, Antonio Gerardo Pepe, Flora De Natale";"The MADIA gridded dataset provides the dekadal series of the main agro-meteorological variables derived from ERA5 hourly surface data, across Italy for the period 1981-2021, and their respective 1981-2010 and 1991-2020 climate normals, also including absolute minimum and maximum and the main quantiles. Temporal and spatial resolutions are 10- day and 0.25 degrees respectively and the dataset is annotated with standard metadata. The dataset was obtained by: (1) estimating the daily time series of minimum, average and maximum air temperature, minimum and maximum air relative humidity, wind speed, surface solar radiation downwards, precipitation and reference evapotranspiration according to the FAO Penman-Monteith method (2) summarising them to 10-day series as accumulated values for precipitation and evapotranspiration and mean values for the other variables. The MADIA dataset is provided in both NetCDF and csv format. A complementary vector file is provided which reports for every cell the fractions covered of the total area of each administrative unit considered to derive statistics for Italy on the European Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics levels (NUTS 2 and 3). Other potential dataset reuses are the estimation of bioclimatic indices and statistical downscaling of climate scenarios."
276;A precise crop row detection algorithm in complex farmland for unmanned agricultural machines;"Zhiwen Ruan, Penghao Chang, Shangqing Cui, Jiaqi Luo, Rui Gao* , Zhongbin Su";"Crop row detection is an important part of precision agriculture. Therefore, an unmanned agricultural machine crop row detection method based on YOLO-R is proposed. This method can solve the problem that traditional image processing methods are easily affected by weeds, light and other factors when extracting crop feature points. First, the YOLO-R object detection algorithm was used to obtain the crop position information, and then, the number of crop rows in the image and the crop in each crop row were obtained by the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Finally, the function expression for each crop row was obtained by using the least squares method. The experimental results show that the AP values of YOLO-R are 91.69%, 95.34% and 89.13% on the seven-day, 14-day, and 21-day rice datasets, respectively. When the proposed algorithms number of parameters was only 12.31% of that of YOLOv4 and the FPS was 17.54 higher than that of YOLOv4, the AP value was only 2.2% lower. The accuracy values of crop row detection algorithm are 93.91%, 95.87% and 89.87% on the seven-day, 14-day, and 21-day rice datasets, respectively, which indicates that the algorithm in this paper can effectively identify crop lines."
277;Between food fulfillment and income: Can urban agriculture contribute to both?;"Oekan S. Abdoellaha,b,* , Yusep Suparmanc , Kinanti Indah Safitri d,* , Akhmad Zainal Mubarak d , Mira Milani e , Margarethd , Levaldo Surya d";"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is appealing for a global implementation of urban agricultural strategies to increase food availability. Bandung, a city in Indonesia, is already participating in this initiative. This research aimed to assess the contribution of urban agriculture toward household food fulfillment and income. Furthermore, the impacts on urban, subsistence, semi-commercial, and commercial agriculture were considered. In-depth interviews to obtain qualitative data and observations were also utilized. A survey of 321 households, consisting of 107 for each urban agricultural type, used questionnaires to obtain quantitative data. These inputs were further analyzed to determine the contribution of household food fulfillment and income. The results showed that average urban agriculture has an insignificant and significant contribution of 9% and 41.5% to household food fulfillment and income. This was due to the vast complexities of metropolitan problems, including limited access to land, lack of participation, dependence on on-market products, and increasing commercialization which opposed urban agricultural policies."
278;Impact of selected land fragmentation parameters and spatial rural settlement patterns on the competitiveness of agriculture: Examples of selected European and Asian countries;"Jaroslaw Janus a,* , Ela Ertunb , Zlatica Muchova? c , Hrvoje Tomi?c d";"Existing methods of assessing land fragmentation (LF) are mainly based on analysis of parameters at the level of plots and individual farms. However, existing methods appear to be insufficient in the assessment of the spatial structure of land at the regional and national levels. The aim of the research is to propose an effective way of comparing the land fragmentation parameters that determine the profitability of agriculture. To estimate the parameters of large-area land fragmentation, data on the spatial distribution of rural settlements and on average land fragmentation parameters were used. A gridbased structure was employed. The grid cell size represents the average size of plots, whereas the numerical values associated with grid cells represent the minimum distances of plots from farm buildings. Using the aforementioned grid and data on the impact on operating costs of plot size and distance from settlements, spatial indicators were obtained that show the diversity of economic costs related to the examined land fragmentation parameters. The obtained results showed a very large variation in the operating conditions of the farms, depending on the LF parameters. The average size of cultivated fields ranges from 0.5 ha (Pakistan) to 67.2 ha (Slovakia), while the average distance of plots from farm buildings ranges from 334 m (China) to 2781 m (Turkey), although the maximum observed values for straight-line distances significantly exceed 7 km, and this value increases to 10 km when the orthogonal layout of roads is taken into account. The density of field boundaries varies from 250 m/ha to over 3500 m/ha, and the associated estimated loss of cultivated area may reach 1.5% of the total cultivated land area (Pakistan). In economic terms, the variability in land cultivation costs related to the size of plots and their distance from buildings varies from 535 EUR/ha/year (Slovakia) to 1412 EUR/ha/year (Greece), which indicates a nearly threefold difference in this aspect. The proposed approach should facilitate an assessment of the competitiveness of agriculture in individual countries. It can also be used when planning land consolidation projects, assessing the risks associated with land abandonment, estimating the negative impact on the environment of fossil fuel combustion effects in agriculture, and determining the impact of land fragmentation parameters on poverty and migration phenomena in rural areas."
279;"A novel comprehensive agricultural drought index reflecting time lag of soil moisture to meteorology: A case study in the Yangtze River basin, China";"Qing Tian a , Jianzhong Lu a,b,* , Xiaoling Chen a,b";"Soil moisture related agriculture drought usually lags behind meteorological factors. In order to address such a hysteresis, the time lag of soil moisture to meteorological factors were initially investigated based on remote sensing products and meteorological observed data in Yangtze River basin. Soil moisture exhibited different lag times to meteorological factors in different climate regions. There is one month lagged in the northwest of the Yangtze River basin, while two months lagged in the middle and east. A novel Comprehensive Agricultural Drought Index (CADI) was then constructed to reflect the feedback of time lag effects in drought assessment, which comprehensively integrated the lagging times of soil moisture to precipitation and evapotranspiration. The CADI was negatively correlated with Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Vegetation Health Index (VHI) and Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), among which the SPEI-3 was most strongly correlated. Drought grades captured by CADI had significantly positive correlations to SPI, SPEI, VHI and RDI captured with correlation coefficients between 0.5 and 0.7. Moreover, the CADI was able to effectively monitor the annual and seasonal variations and spatial pattern of agricultural drought, particularly better identify summer droughts, from which the crop phenology related agriculture drought monitoring can benefit. The temporal variation trend of CADI also agreed to the crop drought-affected area. Therefore, the proposed CADI is superior to characterize agricultural drought by eliminating temporally asynchronous effects of meteorology and soil moisture on drought monitoring. It provides scientific support for hazard assessment and mitigation of regional drought management."
280;Great transition and new pattern: Agriculture and rural area green development and its coordinated relationship with economic growth in China;"Qingqing Zhang a , Yanbo Qu a,b,* , Lingyun Zhan a";"Agricultural and Rural Green Development (ARGD) and economic growth are major challenges prevalent in China, but also in other developing countries. A notable gap in current literature lies in the limited holistic approach to agriculture and rural areas, with scant attention being paid to the spatiotemporal evolution of ARGD and its coordination relationship with economic growth. This paper first offers a theoretical analysis of the interactive relationship between ARGD and economic growth and subsequently examines the policy implementation process in China in this regard. It observes 31 provinces in China from 1997 to 2020 to uncover the spatiotemporal evolution of Agricultural and Rural Green Development Efficiency (ARGDE). Using the coupling coordination degree (CCD) model and the local spatial autocorrelation model, this paper analyses the coordination relationship and spatial correlation between ARGDE and economic growth. The results show that ARGDE in China exhibited a phased growth trend and was greatly affected by policies during 1997?2020. The interregional ARGD produced a hierarchical effect. However, provinces with a higher ARGDE did not necessarily exhibit faster growth, leading to a differential pattern of optimization that involved continuous optimization, phased optimization, and continuous deterioration. Over a long period, ARGDE exhibited a trend of significant upward leaps or jumps. Finally, the CCD between ARGDE and economic growth improved, with a clear trend of high-high agglomeration characteristics that shifted from the eastern and northeastern provinces to the central and western ones. This suggests that promoting ?quality agriculture? and ?green agriculture? can have practical significance in accelerating the development of ARGD. In the future, it is vital to promote ARGD?s transformation while mitigating the risk of degrading the coordinated relationship between ARGD and economic growth."
281;Improved global agricultural crop- and animal-specific ammonia emissions during 1961?2018;"Yuyu Yang a , Lei Liu b,* , Pu Liu b , Jia Ding b , Hang Xu b , Sheng Liu b";"Agriculture is the main source of ammonia (NH3) emissions which result in air pollution and degrade human health. However, the global pattern of NH3 emissions still remains uncertain, and very few studies report the crop- and animal-specific NH3 emissions both regionally and globally. Here, we developed an improved longterm (1961?2018) agricultural NH3 emissions inventory considering the detailed information of crop- and animal-specific sources at 0.5o grids. Global agricultural NH3 emissions were estimated as 39.2 Tg N yr-1 averaged over 1961?2018, driven by livestock production (58.4%) and cropland (41.6%). Cattle, rice, maize and wheat together explain about 53.4% of total agricultural NH3 emissions. Agricultural NH3 emissions increased by 225% from 18.5 Tg N in 1961?60.1 Tg N in 2018 with the increase rate of 2.1% yr-1 (for cropland 3.8% yr-1 and for livestock 1.3% yr-1). Regarding regions, China, India, Brail, Pakistan, United States and European Union accounted for over half of total agricultural NH3 emissions. The hotspots of agricultural NH3 emissions have shifted from the United States and European Union in the 1960s to China and India in recent years. Our findings benefit the understanding of agricultural NH3 dynamics by crops and animals and provide an important reference for the formulation of NH3 pollution prevention and control policy."
282;"Renewable energy utilization, green finance and agricultural land expansion in China";"Hongsheng Zhang a,b , Peizhi Xiong c , Shangzhao Yang a , Jinna Yu d,*";"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, notably carbon dioxide (CO2), are causing anthropogenic global warming, posing severe dangers to the climate, economy, and environment. The dynamic effects of economic development, Renewable Energy (RE) use, green finance, and agricultural production development on CO2 emissions in China are investigated in this study. The ARDL (Auto-regressive distributed lag) bounds testing strategy was used to test series data from 1990 to 2020, supplemented by the DOLS (Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares) method. The results of the DOLS estimate demonstrate that the macroeconomic factor is positively and significantly related to CO2 emission, implying that a 1% rise in business development is associated with a 1.64 percent increase in CO2. Furthermore, the ratio of RE usage is harmful and substantial, meaning that boosting green finance use by 1% reduces CO2 emissions by 0.25 (0.26) percent over time. Moreover, the projected long-run correlation of farmland is positive and statistically significant, indicating that a 1% increase in farm production is associated with a 0.14 (0.15) percent rise in CO2 emissions in the long run. Industrial development and farmland expansion raise Carbon intensity. However, research shows that greater use of renewable energy and green finance will reduce China?s carbon emissions and improve environmental protection. Different estimation techniques, including FMOLS (Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares) and CCR (Canonical Cointegrating Regression), provide similar findings in DOLS. To accomplish a reduction in CO2 emissions and protect the environment, this research provides policy ideas to support renewable energy usage and weather patterns farming toward a low-carbon economy."
283;Propagation characteristics and mechanism from meteorological to agricultural drought in various seasons;"Meng Dai a , Shengzhi Huang a,* , Qiang Huang a , Xudong Zheng a , Xiaoling Su b , Guoyong Leng c , Ziyan Li a , Yi Guo a , Wei Fang a , Yongjia Liu a";"Agricultural drought poses a serious threat to national food security, and the investigation on the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought plays an important role in drought mitigation and social stability. Nevertheless, the seasonal dynamic propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought and its dominant influence factors in a changing environment remain unresolved. To this end, the meteorological drought and agricultural drought are characterized by the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSMI), respectively. The propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought is determined by selecting the maximum conditional probability value between SPI with various timescales and SSMI with time scale of 1 month (SSMI-1). Furthermore, the seasonal dynamic propagation patterns are obtained based on the moving window and Mann-Kendall trend test. Subsequently, the influence factors are explored based on the diverse hydro-meteorological factors and irrigation water consumption. The Wei River Basin (WRB), a typical arid and semi-arid as well as an important agricultural production area in China, is taken as the research object. Results manifest that: (1) it is more suitable to determine the drought propagation time by conditional probability method considering linear and nonlinear relations simultaneously (2) the seasonal propagation time of the whole basin is getting shorter as a whole, especially in the main stream basin (3) the increasing temperature and decreasing soil moisture and precipitation have strong effects on the propagation dynamics while irrigation water consumption has a little influence, and teleconnection factors may indirectly affect drought propagation by influencing hydro-meteorological factors. Overall, it is of great significance to study the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought for drought prevention, drought resistance and food security."
284;Does forest farm carbon sink projects affect agricultural development? Evidence from a Quasi-experiment in China;"Jian Liu a , Yanjun Ren a,b,* , Yu Hong c , Thomas Glauben a";"Forest Farm Carbon Sink (FFCS) projects are one of the effective ways to achieve carbon neutrality and mitigate global warming. Though the existing literature has widely discussed the effect of FFCS on the allocation of agricultural factors, such as land, labor employment structure and income structure, little is known about whether FFCS projects could have an effect on agricultural development. Based on the panel data of 140 counties in Sichuan province, China, from 2002 to 2018, we examined the causal effect on agricultural total factor productivity (TFP), and revealed their dynamic effect and underlying mechanisms. Propensity score matching and the difference in difference (PSM-DID) method were used to address the endogeneity problem of FFCS implementation. Results showed that FFCS projects increased agricultural TFP by 1.7%?2.4%. Health, saving and industrial structure were the important channels through which FFCS projects affect agricultural TFP. Our findings suggest that policies promoting FFCS projects can increase agricultural TFP while achieving environmental goals?a win-win situation."
285;Enabling conditions for scaling natural climate solutions in Canada?s agriculture sector;"Lisa Ashton * , Ben Bradshaw";"Natural climate solutions can contribute to climate change mitigation and other environmental and social goals. An emerging body of academic and gray literature seeks to identify how governance ecosystems, inclusive of diverse actors, the mechanisms they employ, and the conditions they create, can actualize the potential of natural climate solutions. Enabling conditions are a critical component of these governance ecosystems as they describe the conditions needed to achieve a desired outcome. However, limited empirical research explores what conditions and combinations of conditions might promote the implementation of natural climate solutions across agricultural landscapes. This paper aims to identify and categorize enabling conditions for scaling natural climate solutions adoption in agriculture to address this gap. This objective is achieved through 51 semi-structured key informant interviews with diverse experts engaged in climate action in Canada?s agriculture sector, which are corroborated with relevant literature. The expertise of key informants includes: agricultural production agricultural technology climate and environmental policy and markets sustainable investment sustainable sourcing and agri-food supply chains measuring, reporting, and verification of ecosystem services technical assistance and ecosystem modeling. Findings from the interviews suggest that the potential for natural climate solutions adoption is currently limited by several critical barriers, including regulatory uncertainty, insufficient investment in measuring and monitoring infrastructure, and a lack of accessible and relevant resources to inform and guide actors. Aggregated findings point to four principal enabling conditions that together form the foundational conditions for an enabling governance ecosystem for natural climate solutions adoption in agriculture: (1) coordinated and coherent governance approaches (2) favourable market conditions (3) streamlined and robust measuring, reporting and verification and (4) capacity among actors. This paper?s contribution includes identifying and organizing enabling conditions for scaling the adoption of agriculture-based natural climate solutions, which can help better position actors to build an effective governance ecosystem in Canada?s agriculture sector and elsewhere."
286;Structural change and energy use in Ghana?s manufacturing and agriculture sectors;"Samuel Amoako a,* , Francis Kwaw Andoh b , Emmanuel Ekow Asmah c";"This paper examines energy use under policy regime changes (that is, before and after the Economic Recovery Programme/Structural Adjustment Programme (ERP)/(SAP)) in Ghana, paying attention to the extent to which the regime switch moderates energy use in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors which are two key sectors of the economy. Employing the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) on data spanning 1971?2014, the study finds the structural change policy to be positively correlated with energy use. Agriculture and manufacturing also have positive impacts on energy use. As a policy direction, subsequent structural change policies that focus on increasing output, especially in the private sector, must come along with the needed energy use strategy. Also, the agriculture and manufacturing sectors should be focused on production mixes and systems that are energy efficient"
287;Developing a Decision-making Tool for Agricultural Surface Water Decontamination Using Ultraviolet-C Light;"Olivia C. Haley 1 , Yeqi Zhao 1 , Trevor Hefley 2 , Logan L. Britton 3 , Londa Nwadike 4,5 , Cary Rivard 6 , Manreet Bhullar 1,7";"Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light-assisted water treatment systems are an increasingly investigated alternative to chemical sanitizers for agricultural surface water decontamination. However, the relatively high concentration of particulate matter in surface water is a major challenge to expanding its application in the production of fresh produce. The objective of this project was to test the efficacy of two commercial UV-C devices to reduce the microbial risk of agricultural water in order to develop a web application to assist growers in decision- making related to the on-farm implementation of UV-C technologies for agricultural water treatment. An on- farm study using three agricultural water sources was performed to determine the microbial reduction efficacy of a low power, low flow (LP/LF 1?9 gallons per minute (GPM), 1.34-gallon capacity) and a high powered, high flow (HP/HF 1?110 GPM, 4.75-gallon capacity) device at flow rates of 6, 7, and 9 GPM. A threshold of 30% UVT for the HP/HF device was observed, wherein lower water transmissibility significantly impacted microbial inactivation. Although less effective at lower %UVT, the LP/LF device costs less to install, maintain, and operate. The observations were used to design an online tool for growers to calculate the predicted reduction of generic Escherichia coli using either device based on the %UVT of their water source. However, because this study utilized an exploratory and proof-of-concept approach, the experimental flow rates were limited to reflect the capacities of the smaller unit (9 GPM) for direct comparison to the larger unit. Thus, the preliminary model and tool are largely limited to the experimental conditions. Yet, these results of this study demonstrate the utility of UV-C light in reducing the microbial risk of agricultural water, and future studies using different UV-C devices and higher flow rates will expand the use of the decision-making tool."

289;High-resolution propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought at multiple levels and spatiotemporal scales;"Yifei Li a , Shengzhi Huang a,* , Hanye Wang a , Xudong Zheng a , Qiang Huang a , Mingjiang Deng a,b , Jian Peng c,d";"Meteorological drought (MD) is the source of agricultural drought (AD), and in-depth understanding of the propagation process from MD to AD can help AD early warning. However, previous studies primarily focused on average state of propagation time (PT) rather than from the perspective of various drought levels, and had coarse spatiotemporal resolutions (monthly and basin scales), and also ignored the PT during critical stages of crop water demand. To fill the knowledge gap, this study used the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized soil moisture index (SSMI) to characterize MD and AD. Then, a framework for high-resolution PT identification under different drought levels based on Copula theory and conditional probability was proposed. Taking the rain-fed agricultural region of Loess Plateau (RFLP) as an example, the PT of the critical stages of water demand for local crops (spring maize, winter wheat) was calculated respectively. Result showed that: (1) PT in summer and autumn is shorter than those in winter and spring, and the higher drought level, the faster the spreading rate, in which the PT in spring, summer, autumn, and winter under extreme MD conditions were 3?15, 1?6, 1?8 and 4?16 ten days, respectively (2) it should be noted that the central part of RFLP is a hotspot, with a shorter PT than any surrounding area (3) PT is mainly related to local water and heat characteristics, and high potential evapotranspiration tends to accelerate the propagation process, while sufficient soil moisture has a good buffering effect on MD and can slow down the propagation (4) it was observed that PT in the jointingheading stage of wheat was significantly shortened, which should be of great concern to the local agricultural authorities. In general, this study sheds new insights into high spatiotemporal resolution drought propagation, which is helpful for AD risk management."

Results manifest that: (1) it is more suitable to determine the drought propagation time by conditional probability method considering linear and nonlinear relations simultaneously (2) the seasonal propagation time of the whole basin is getting shorter as a whole, especially in the main stream basin (3) the increasing temperature and decreasing soil moisture and precipitation have strong effects on the propagation dynamics while irrigation water consumption has a little influence, and teleconnection factors may indirectly affect drought propagation by influencing hydro-meteorological factors. Overall, it is of great significance to study the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought for drought prevention, drought resistance and food security."
291;Developing a Decision-making Tool for Agricultural Surface Water Decontamination Using Ultraviolet-C Light;"Olivia C. Haley 1 , Yeqi Zhao 1 , Trevor Hefley 2 , Logan L. Britton 3 , Londa Nwadike 4,5 , Cary Rivard 6 , Manreet Bhullar 1,7";"Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light-assisted water treatment systems are an increasingly investigated alternative to chemical sanitizers for agricultural surface water decontamination. However, the relatively high concentration of particulate matter in surface water is a major challenge to expanding its application in the production of fresh produce. The objective of this project was to test the efficacy of two commercial UV-C devices to reduce the microbial risk of agricultural water in order to develop a web application to assist growers in decision- making related to the on-farm implementation of UV-C technologies for agricultural water treatment. An on- farm study using three agricultural water sources was performed to determine the microbial reduction efficacy of a low power, low flow (LP/LF 1?9 gallons per minute (GPM), 1.34-gallon capacity) and a high powered, high flow (HP/HF 1?110 GPM, 4.75-gallon capacity) device at flow rates of 6, 7, and 9 GPM. A threshold of 30% UVT for the HP/HF device was observed, wherein lower water transmissibility significantly impacted microbial inactivation. Although less effective at lower %UVT, the LP/LF device costs less to install, maintain, and operate. The observations were used to design an online tool for growers to calculate the predicted reduction of generic Escherichia coli using either device based on the %UVT of their water source. However, because this study utilized an exploratory and proof-of-concept approach, the experimental flow rates were limited to reflect the capacities of the smaller unit (9 GPM) for direct comparison to the larger unit. Thus, the preliminary model and tool are largely limited to the experimental conditions. Yet, these results of this study demonstrate the utility of UV-C light in reducing the microbial risk of agricultural water, and future studies using different UV-C devices and higher flow rates will expand the use of the decision-making tool."
292;Toward carbon neutrality before 2060: Trajectory and technical mitigation potential of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from Chinese agriculture;"Minpeng Chen a , Yanrong Cui a , Shan Jiang a , Nicklas Forsell b,";"In 2020, China announced that it aims to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Despite the recognition of agriculture?s importance in emission mitigation strategies, assessing the non-CO2 greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potentials from this sector remains technically and conceptually challenging. This study developed a bottom-up inventory-based model (the Agriculture-induced non-CO2 GreenHouse Gases INVentory model) to provide region-specific long-term projections (to 2060) of non-CO2 GHG emissions (including methane and nitrous oxide) from the Chinese agricultural sector. Seventeen production-side technologies were identified that could reduce on-farm emissions, and their mitigation potentials by 2060 were evaluated. Results showed that agricultural non-CO2 GHG emissions rose by 34% from 1980 to 2018, and they are projected to increase further by 33% to reach 1153 MtCO2-eq yr- 1 by 2060. Implementing selected technological adaptations could lead to peak agricultural emissions before 2030 and then reduce them by 32%?50% by 2060. The most effective mitigation measures include feed supplements, feed quality improvements, slow-release fertilizers, and improved water management for paddy fields and uplands. All six regions of China will see a gradual increase in agricultural emissions. South Central China and Southwest China have the largest shares of total national emissions and the greatest mitigation potentials. However, technology adoption faces a series of socio-economic obstacles such as the high cost of technology promotion, smaller farm sizes, farmers? aversion to risk, and a complex set of objectives for agriculture."
293;FAIR degree assessment in agriculture datasets using the F-UJI tool;"Luiza Petrosyan a , Rafael Aleixandre-Benavent b,c,d , Fernanda Peset a , Juan Carlos Valderrama-Zuri? an b,c , Antonia Ferrer-Sapena a , Andrea Sixto-Costoya a,b,c,";"For the agricultural scientific community, data sharing is crucial both for the advancement of the discipline and ability to meet global challenges, such as the target no. 2, i.e., ?Zero Hunger,? of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 2030). In this context, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles play an important role, as they guarantee the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of shared data. To improve the practice of data sharing, institutions, funders, and publishers are increasingly demanding data be shared as well as be of an acceptable level of quality, including compliance with FAIR principles. Therefore, the objective of this work is twofold: first, this research aims to determine the degree of compliance with the FAIR principles exhibited by a number of datasets and second, it aims to explore useful and valid methodologies and procedures that can be used to perform this evaluation quickly, automatically, and effectively. For this purpose, the Data Citation Index (DCI) was used to obtain many datasets in the field of agriculture, which were further grouped by repositories and evaluated using the automated assessment tool F-UJI provided by the FAIRsFAIR project. The results indicated that the principle that exhibited the highest scores was ?Findable?, while ?Reusable? received the lowest scores, as none of the analysed repositories achieved a 50% compliance score in this respect. The datasets published in the Zenodo and Dryad repositories exhibited better overall results in terms of the FAIR principles, and the AG Commons repository was the third best rated repository, representing only one of the first three repositories belonging to the agricultural sector. Regarding the use of F-UJI as an automated assessment tool and DCI as a source for obtaining datasets, we conclude that this methodology is useful, and that although it can be improved, it is easy to use and implement by other scientific groups and agents of interest."
294;Water pricing reform for sustainable water resources management in China?s agricultural sector;"Cheng-Yao Zhang * , Taikan Oki";"Strengthening water resource management and improving water-use efficiency are crucial for sustainable development, as described in the Target 6.4 of the Sustainable Development Goals. Compared with developed countries, developing countries are facing some general obstacles on agricultural water management from policy making, pricing mechanisms, infrastructure, and subsidy implementations, which has left developing countries with little progress in improving agricultural water management through water pricing. However, China is moving towards more sustainable water resource management in the agricultural sector by implementing a nationwide agricultural water pricing reform. The ongoing reform contributes to the improvement of water use efficiency and water-saving rate through the core pricing mechanisms of ?reasonable pricing? and ?precise subsidies and water saving incentives?. In the meanwhile, the measure of ?infrastructure development and management? safeguards the reform implementation and water pricing combined with ?quota control management? is the tool to improve the agricultural water management. The progress of the reform shows that China has achieved remarkable results in water conservation and increasing water use efficiency but has also revealed uneven progress across the country and challenges to financial sustainability. China?s changes in agricultural water pricing shows that an integrated water pricing method based on farmers? affordability is a pragmatic option for developing countries, but the implementation urgently requires upgrading of irrigation infrastructure and management systems. The policies of precise subsidies and water-saving incentives provide a solution to price failure caused by excessive subsidies that are common in developing countries. The financial constraints of current reform highlight the importance of diversifying funding channels for financial sustainability. The lessons and implications of China could provide insights for developing countries on sustainable water management in the agricultural sector."

To accelerate progress, post-graduate education ? of future researchers, policy-makers and practitioners ? that promotes interdisciplinary knowledge and skills is imperative. We report findings from a mixed-methods needs assessment designed to assess enabling and constraining factors to integrated agriculture, nutrition, and health education. An online questionnaire was disseminated among experts in relevant disciplines, followed by focus group discussions among faculty members teaching in post-graduate institutions in low- and middle-income countries. We find that student motivation, instructor background, fixed curricula, and siloes among implementation agencies are important barriers to interdisciplinary education. Experiential learning and collaborations within and across institutions are enabling factors. We present key aspects of an interdisciplinary educational model that consider systemic and institutional realities of specialized institutions and low funding."
296;Multi-site evaluation of stratified and balanced sampling of soil organic carbon stocks in agricultural fields;"Eric Potash a,b,* , Kaiyu Guan a,b,c , Andrew J.

Stratified sampling is a classic strategy for estimating mean soil properties, and has recently been codified in SOC monitoring protocols. However, for the specific task of estimating the SOC stock of an agricultural field, concrete guidance is needed for which covariates to stratify on and how much stratification can improve estimation efficiency. It is also unknown how stratified sampling of SOC stocks compares to modern alternatives, notably doubly balanced sampling. To address these gaps, we collected highdensity (average of 7 samples ha- 1 ) and deep (average of 75 cm) measurements of SOC stocks at eight commercial fields under maize-soybean production in two US Midwestern states. We combined these measurements with a Bayesian geostatistical model to evaluate stratified and balanced sampling strategies that use a set of readily-available geographic, topographic, spectroscopic, and soil survey data. We examined the number of samples needed to achieve a given level of SOC stock estimation accuracy. While stratified sampling using these variables enables an average sample size reduction of 17% (95% CI, 11% to 23%) compared to simple random sampling, doubly balanced sampling is consistently more efficient, reducing sample sizes by 32% (95% CI, 25% to 37%). The data most important to these efficiency gains are a remotely-sensed SOC index, SSURGO estimates of SOC stocks, and the topographic wetness index. We conclude that in order to meet the urgent challenge of climate change, SOC stocks in agricultural fields could be more efficiently estimated by taking advantage of this readily-available data, especially with doubly balanced sampling."
297;Relationships between agricultural growth and energy consumption in China: Toda?Yamamoto tests;Gaolu Zou*;"This article analyzed the causal link between the growth in agricultural output value and total primary energy consumption for both the 1953 to 2020 and 1980 to 2020 periods. The main method applied is the Toda?Yamamoto Wald-? 2 test. Empirical results show that from 1953 to 2020, feedback existed between the growth in agricultural output and energy use. From 1980 to 2020, unidirectional Granger causality existed from energy consumption to the aggregate economy and agriculture. Thus, the study suggests the growth hypothesis in energy economics. In the short-run, agricultural growth will not increase energy consumption. However, strict energy-saving measures in the agricultural sector may curb its growth. During the period after 1980, agricultural energy use efficiency improved. Energy consumption was a short-run determinant of agricultural growth."
298;Recent advances in transforming agricultural biorefinery lignins into value-added products;"Xiang Wang a , Weiqi Leng b , R.M. Oshani Nayanathara c , David Milsted d , Thomas L. Eberhardt e , Zhao Zhang a , Xuefeng Zhang c";"Each year, agricultural residues such as stalks, husks, and pits/nutshells from food crop harvesting are available on a gigatonne scale worldwide. While biorefinery routes have been used convert agricultural residue carbohydrates into value-added products (e.g., bioethanol, biochemicals), the lignin, comprising 20?50% of the dry mass of agricultural residues, remains largely underutilized. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the utilization of agricultural biorefinery lignins for value-added products. In this review, we briefly introduce the origins of agricultural lignins, discuss their structural differences, and compare them with the more commonly studied wood lignins. We highlight in greater detail the recent advances in using agricultural lignins as macromonomers/fillers for polymer syntheses that include epoxies and polyurethanes. The use of agricultural lignins as carbon-rich precursors for the preparation of carbon fibers, supercapacitor electrodes, and carbon foams are also discussed, as well as their use for other applications such as additives for fertilizer release control and UVshielding. Altogether, this review provides key developments in the progress made to date for agricultural lignin utilization that may help promote future innovation in the field."
299;Pockets of persistence of agricultural land use during the socioeconomic shock of forced post-WWII displacements in the Carpathians;"Andrzej N. Affek a,b,* , Zofia Jabs-Sobocinska ? a,c , Jacek Wolski a , Volker C. Radeloff b";"Socioeconomic shocks can cause regime shifts in land use, but even during shocks, and when land use change is widespread, some areas persist in their land use. The question is what makes these areas more resistant. Our research goal was to find out what explains where arable farming persisted despite a major socioeconomic shock of forced post-war displacements. Our study area were 291 villages in the Polish Carpathians where abandonment due to the forced displacement of the Ukrainian population after WWII was widespread. We compared prewar arable land with 1990 CORINE Land Cover data to quantify land-use change throughout the socialist period. We applied logistic regression with economically relevant environmental and access-related variables, and assessed the explanatory power of our models and relative importance of determinants. Forty years after forced displacements, arable farming persisted only in a small portion of what had been farmed in the 1940s (16 %), while the majority of former arable land converted to forests (54 %) or grasslands (22 %). Arable farming persisted mainly in areas with high accessibility that had oak-hornbeam forest as potential natural vegetation, on less steep slopes, and at lower elevations. Our models predicting agricultural abandonment leading to reforestation performed well (R2 = 0.57), but our model of persistent agriculture had low explanatory power (R2 = 0.26) as did models of conversion to grassland (R2 = 0.24). We therefore conclude that agricultural persistence is driven by different factors than agricultural land abandonment. In the long term, after arable farming ceases, areas can either be completely abandoned or convert to less intensive grassland use. These long-term changes have strong effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services, but are not well predicted by environmental and access-related determinants. Our findings can help to develop strategies and policies for areas affected by agricultural land abandonment caused by depopulation, and other socioeconomic shocks, and highlight the need to understand not only why arable land is abandoned, but also what determines its long-term fate."
300;Assessment of agricultural drought based on multi-source remote sensing data in a major grain producing area of Northwest China;"Siyang Cai a , Depeng Zuo a,* , Huixiao Wang a,* , Zongxue Xu a , GuoQing Wang b , Hong Yang c";"Drought is considered to be one of the most serious natural disasters in China, which can result in enormous damage to nature and socio-economy. Compared to traditional ground-based monitoring techniques, remote sensing can effectively compensate for spatial discontinuities at ground stations. The use of remote sensing technology for drought monitoring has irreplaceable advantages. The applicability of the TRMM3B43 dataset for precipitation was firstly verified in the Wei River basin, and the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation were analyzed. Based on the TRMM3B43, MODIS NDVI, and MODIS LST datasets, the spatiotemporal variations of drought were secondly investigated by calculating the Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Temporal Condition Index (TCI). Crop yield was employed as the reference of drought impact for evaluating the applicability of the Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI) based on the combination of the PCI, VCI, and VCI by four kinds of weight determination methods, i.e. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Entropy method, Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC), and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE). Finally, the agricultural drought calculated by the SDCI was evaluated against drought area, disaster area, and crop failure area to verify the applicability of the SDCI for agricultural drought disaster assessment in the Wei River basin. The results showed that the SDCI determined by FCE has better correlations with crop yield (R2 =0.45) than the other methods. The SDCI values exhibited a W shape from 2003 to 2010 during the growing seasons and agricultural drought showed an increasing trend after 2013. The drought-prone areas shifted from north to south, with the degree of drought firstly decreasing and then increasing. In addition, the SDCI has better correlations with the disaster area (R2 =0.35) than the drought area (R2 = 0.16). At the municipal level, the SDCI could well assess agricultural drought. The results demonstrated that the SDCI can effectively monitor and assess drought impacts on agriculture and may provide helpful information for agricultural drought disaster prevention."
301;"What influences the behavior of farmers? participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution control??Evidence from a farmer survey in Huai?an, China";"Jun Ma a , Huixian Gao a , Changgao Cheng a,b,*,1 , Zhou Fang a , Qin Zhou a , Haiwei Zhou a,b";"Due to high-intensity agricultural production activities and the excessive use of chemical substances such as fertilizers and pesticides, agricultural nonpoint source pollution has surpassed industrial and urban residential pollution to become the number one contributor to nonpoint source pollution in China. Promoting farmers? participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management is a key link to achieve the goal of sustainable agricultural development. Based on an expanded theory of planned behavior, we identified the key influencing factors of farmers? participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management. According to microsurvey data from 600 farmers in Huai?an, China, we used a structural equation model to analyze in depth the influence of farmers? internal cognition and their perceptions of the external environment to explore the formation mechanism of their participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management behavior. The study shows that, first, government regulations promote the green development of the agricultural market environment and social organizations and that farmers? perceptions of the external environment strengthen the influence of their internal cognition but are not fully significant. Second, farmers? internal cognition can enhance their willingness to participate, and the influence of attitudes is the strongest. Finally, there is a positive relationship between the level of response of farmers? participation in pollution control behavior and their perceived behavioral control and willingness to control. Based on the above analysis, we propose policy recommendations in terms of government regulation, market regulation, organization construction, and multisubject collaboration to mobilize the enthusiasm of various subjects and to improve the efficiency of agricultural nonpoint source pollution management."
302;Agricultural drought in the Vietnamese Central Highlands at 1-km resolution: Monthly and annual datasets;"Thuong V. Trana,* , Duy X. Tranb , Duy B. Nguyenc";"Drought is a complex natural hazard which can create significant impacts on society and environment. Given that this phenomenon varies across space and changes over time dependent on various factors (e.g., physical conditions and human activities), the available of spatiotemporal drought data enables a better monitoring and assessment of drought severity This study introduced the integrated multivariate drought index (iMDI) data, a new regional drought index, at 1 km spatial and monthly temporal resolutions for the Vietnamese Central Highlands over a 20-years period. The iMDI was developed recently which is a combination of vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), and the evaporative stress index (ESI) based on the feature of scaling algorithms (i.e., normalisations and standardisation). The data were processed using the median values of MODIS time-series imagery obtained from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The iMDI datasets are available for monthly and annual drought monitoring between 2001 and 2020. Additionally, the datasets of VCI, TCI, and ESI were provided so that users can apply for their own purposes even thoughthese data can directly obtain from GEE or other sources. Users, especially those without technical expertise, can reap the advantages of having open access to iDMI data. By doing so, they can reduce their expenses and the time required to process data. As such, this accessibility can promote the use of data for diverse  pplications, such as evaluating the impact of droughts on the environment and human activitiesand monitoring droughts regionally"

The use of digital technologies can support this by designing and managing resource-efficient and context-specific agricultural systems. We present the Digital Agricultural Knowledge and Information System (DAKIS) to demonstrate an approach that employs digital technologies to enable decision-making towards diversified and sustainable agriculture. To develop the DAKIS, we specified, together with stakeholders, requirements for a knowledge-based decision-support tool and reviewed the literature to identify limitations in the current generation of tools. The results of the review point towards recurring challenges regarding the consideration of ecosystem services and biodiversity, the capacity to foster communication and cooperation between farmers and other actors, and the ability to link multiple spatiotemporal scales and sustainability levels. To overcome these challenges, the DAKIS provides a digital platform to support farmers decision-making on land use and management via an integrative spatiotemporally explicit approach that analyses a wide range of data from various sources. The approach integrates remote and in situ sensors, artificial intelligence, modelling, stakeholder-stated demand for biodiversity and ecosystem services, and participatory sustainability impact assessment to address the diverse drivers affecting agricultural land use and management design, including natural and agronomic factors, economic and policy considerations, and socio-cultural preferences and settings. Ultimately, the DAKIS embeds the consideration of ecosystem services, biodiversity, and sustainability into farmers decision-making and enables learning and progress towards site-adapted small-scale multifunctional and diversified agriculture while simultaneously supporting farmers objectives and societal demands."

Ferreira b,c,* , Georgia Destouni b , Pan Haozhi d , Marlon Vieira Passos e , Karina Barquet e , Zahra Kalantari a,b";"Agricultural drought can severely reduce crop yields, lead to large economic losses and health impacts. Combined climate and land use variations determine key indicators of agricultural drought, including soil moisture and the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI). This study investigated the use of machine learning (ML) methods for predicting these indicators over Sweden, spanning steep climate and land use gradients. Three data arrangement methods (multi-features, temporal, and spatial) were used and compared in combination with seven ML/deep learning (DL) models (random forest (RF), decision tree, multivariate linear regression, support vector regression, autoregressive integrated moving average (AMIRA), artificial neural network, and convolutional neural network). Seven investigated features, obtained from Google Earth Engine, were used in the ML/DL modeling (soil moisture, PDSI, precipitation, evapotranspiration, elevation, slope and soil texture). The temporal ARIMA model (found most suitable for local scale prediction) and the multi-features RF model (more suitable for national-scale prediction) emerged as best performing for soil moisture prediction (with MAE of 9.1 and 11.95, and R2 of 0.79 and 0.59, respectively). All models generally performed better in predicting the soil moisture than the PDSI indicator of drought. For drought indicator prediction and mapping, previous-year average monthly soil moisture emerged as the most important feature, combined with the four additional corresponding features of PDSI, precipitation, evapotranspiration and elevation."

Kraa , B?enger Koffia , Michal Habel c , Dibi Broua , Siguyama Hironobud, Emmanuel N. Assidjoe";"In this study, the agro-hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool + (SWAT+) is used to simulate runoff in an uncontrolled agricultural catchment with paddy fields irrigated by plots submersion. The objectives are to evaluate the ability of this new, improved version of the SWAT model to reproduce the flows in a complex catchment and to analyse the evolution of these flows over the historical period 1986-2020 (35 years). Sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation were carried out with monthly flow data. The decision tables for irrigation operations and reservoir water release were filled in the SWAT+ Editor to establish the reservoir water balance. The Mann-Kendall trend test with the threshold of the standard normal statistic = 1.96, was applied to the time series of flows to the Nanan Reservoir. The results reveal that SWAT+ is more sensitive to eight parameters, including the new CN3_SWF parameter (-0.04329), which gave the user control of the soil saturation level. Good performances were obtained during calibration and validation, respectively: NSE (0.78 0.69) R? (0.81 0.70) PBIAS (-18.58 -23.9) and RSR (0.47 0.56), with a tendency to slightly overestimate flows. The analysis shows that flows to the Nanan Reservoir are highly variable yearly, with a non-significant upward trend (|Z|=1.3<1.96) from 1986 to 2020. The water balance reveals that the runoff inflow generated will compensate for water withdrawals for irrigation of the Nanan paddy scheme during this period. Furthermore, this study provides a methodological framework for SWAT+ reservoir model calibration in an uncontrolled catchment."
306;Research and application of agricultural energy Internet intelligent system for live streaming E-commerce based on MATLAB analysis in China;"Ye Mina,b,* , Chai Ching Tana";"This study focus on the agricultural energy Internet, which the concept of ?Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction? makes agriculture an essential direction for the development of the energy Internet. Agricultural Energy Internet will change the way energy is produced, transported, and consumed, further affect people?s lives, promote energy transformation, improve energy efficiency, and contribute to the realization of circular economy and sustainable rural development. China has realized the coordinated development of ?New agriculture?, ?new energy?, and ?Live streaming E-commerce? and contributed to the revitalization of rural areas. Based on the problems existing in agricultural energy internet, this study solves the problems existing to ensure the safety and reliability of the photovoltaic power generation system connected to the grid. This study uses the MATLAB model to simulate and analyze the changes in working conditions. The power input can be realized quickly, and the frequency and phase of the power grid can be tracked to meet grid connection requirements. The simulation analysis of SPWM current by MATLAB shows that the control model can quickly realize grid voltage and grid-connected current phase tracking. At 0.06 s, MPPT can be well controlled so that the grid voltage and the grid current are in the same frequency and phase to meet the requirements of the grid. In the energy Internet of agricultural parks, on the one hand, intelligent photovoltaic technology can solve the problem of resource waste in China?s agricultural production and reduce the waste of hydropower resources through more accurate methods than manual observation On the other hand, photovoltaic power generation and intelligent irrigation can make the use of facility agriculture cleaner and smarter, optimize the agricultural energy structure and reduce labor intensity."
307;Co-producing agricultural policy with beekeepers: Obstacles and opportunities;Siobhan Maderson;"Dominant agricultural practices are widely recognised as one of many factors leading to severe declines in honey bees and other pollinators. Improving the agri-environment for pollinators and other species is an urgent ecological priority. Beekeepers have long been at the forefront of recognising agricultural and environmental challenges to their bees many of these also impact other pollinators. As the UK moves towards a post-Brexit agricultural policy, this should be an excellent time for beekeepers? observations and concerns to be recognised, and contribute to a system where farmers and land managers ensure the delivery of ?public goods?. However, evidence suggests significant obstacles to effectively co-producing agricultural policy that ensures pollinator wellbeing. This paper is based on archival and interview data on long-term beekeepers throughout the UK. Beekeepers? past experience of engaging with agricultural, and pollinator health policy stakeholders highlights significant obstacles to effective co-production of policy. Beekeepers? experiential observations are commonly dismissed as anecdotal, and subsequently irrelevant knowledge, according to scientifically and politically acknowledged epistemological categories. Multiple stakeholders in agriculture and land management have opposing priorities, and unequal access to power. This presents significant challenges to government efforts to overcome boundaries and co-produce actionable policy. Internationally, significant steps have been made to incorporate hybrid knowledge, and its associated value systems into environmental governance. Developing agricultural policy which acknowledges and incorporates multiple forms of evidence and pro-environmental values is necessary for a successful post-Brexit agricultural system focused on Environmental Land Management, public goods, and multiple values of nature."
308;The environmental impact of agriculture: An instrument to support public policy;"Giulio Fusco a,* , Francesco Campobasso b , Lucio Laureti c , Massimo Frittelli d , Donatella Valente e , Irene Petrosillo e,f";"Agriculture is a key activity in guarantying food security, one of the Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN Agenda 2030 for sustainable development. However, agriculture can be an environmental impacting activity when it is managed without attention towards its environmental efficiency. Thus, the assessment of ecoefficiency in agriculture is a crucial tool to evaluate this economic activity in terms of both natural resources exploitation and revenue generation. To address the complex issues associated with this problematic trade-off, the application of a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been to assess the environmental and economic performance of agriculture in terms of eco-efficiency. DEA has been applied the Italian case study at regional level, to provide policy-makers with a synthetic indicator of agricultural sustainability, when implementing funding policies. In particular, the analysis of the case study has taken into account the implementation of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), as implemented through the Rural Development Plans. Our approach is a first step in the direction of assessing the long-lasting issue of developing benchmarking policies between the different Italian regions. This works paves the way to future and more in-depth studies needed to determine the eco-efficiency at local scale and, thus, the possibility to identify specific forms of agriculture as nature-based solutions."
309;Utilizing residual biomasses from agriculture and forestry: Different approaches to set system boundaries in environmental and economic life-cycle assessments;"Christoph Siol a,* , Daniela Thran? a,b , Stefan Majer a";"Utilizing residual biomass resources in industrial processes has become a major topic in the scientific and political discourse about the bioeconomy. Especially residues from agriculture and forestry play an important role in the future bioeconomy since there are significant utilizable resource potentials and various high-value product opportunities. However, these resources contain valuable plant nutrients and can be important for soil organic carbon balancing wherefore large amounts of these residues currently remain on the cultivation area to maintain the soil health and fertility. To ensure a sustainable resource provision it is necessary to address the various trade-offs by integrating them into appropriate assessment methods. A review of 162 included studies shall reveal how environmental and economic Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies handle the multi-functionality of agricultural and forest production systems and address the various effects from an extraction. The main findings can be summarized as follows. ?There is no unified method to quantify the life-cycle environmental or economic effects from the utilization of residual biomasses from agriculture or forestry, but rather four basic approaches of system boundary settings. ?Individual LCA results from the literature are not cross-comparable due to the different system boundary settings, leading to high uncertainties regarding the actual life-cycle impacts of a technical utilization. ?Several aspects of a sustainable resource extraction remain neglected by any of the studies, e.g. effects of a soil organic carbon build-up on soil fertility, soil biodiversity, and crop yields or displacement effects when residual biomasses are currently used for other purposes."
310;How to effectively improve the ecosystem provisioning services in traditional agricultural and pastoral areas in China?;"Haijiang Yang a,b , Xiaohua Gou a,b,* , Bing Xue c , Jing Xu a , Weijing Ma a,b";"The provisioning services of ecosystems are fundamental for people?s livelihoods, health, and survival, yet provisioning services are highly dependent on land use/cover change (LUCC), especially in fragile alpine ecosystems. In the Qilian Mountains, one of China?s traditional farming and pastoral areas, changes in provisioning services are related to regional well-being. This study focuses on the multi-scale evolution, driving factors, and sustainable development strategies for providing farmland and grassland ecosystem services from 2000 to 2020. The results showed an overall upward trend in the value of providing services by grassland and cropland ecosystems over the past 20 years, increasing by US $249 million and US $67.35 million, respectively. The economic benefits of livestock products provided by grassland and agricultural products from farmland accounted for 70.5% and 29.5% of the total income of farmers and herdsmen, respectively. However, in the past 10 years, the contribution of grassland and farmland ecosystems to provisioning services has decreased by 0.2% and 1.7% respectively. The reduction of contribution will directly affect the capacity to provisioning services, which is not conducive to regional development. It is found that human factors such as policy system change, urbanization process and ideological change are the main driving factors for the change of supply services in traditional agricultural and pastoral areas, and climate change has played a certain role in promoting. In order to effectively improve the ability of traditional agricultural and pastoral areas to provide services, we put forward the development strategy of ?Ecological Husbandry + Precision Agriculture (EHPA)?. and promote the ?Production, Learning, Scientific research and Practical application? of ecosystem services from the five aspects of ecological space, industrial layout, ecological industrial development, ecological technology and ecological policy system, so as to improve the ability of ecosystem provisioning services."
311;Economic integration and survival of Ghana?s manufactured and agriculture raw material exports;"Prince Teye-Gaga a,* , Camara Kwasi Obeng a , Benedict Afful a , Michael Tutu Boadu b";"he paper investigates the effects of economic integration agreements on the survival of Ghana?s manufactured and agriculture raw material exports. Using annual trade data for Ghanaian manufactured and agriculture raw material product exports from 1988 to 2018 and a discretetime proportional hazard model, we found that economic integration agreements enhance the survival of manufactured products and agriculture raw material exports. The Non-Reciprocal Preferential Trade Agreement is the most survival-enhancing. In addition, economic integration agreements strengthen the survival of existing active export relations but decrease the survival of export relations initiated after the agreement was signed. We also found that the average duration of manufactured products and agriculture raw material exports is 9.041 and 8.817 years, respectively. The study recommends that the Ministry of Trade and Industry should continue negotiating for Non-Reciprocal Trade Agreements."
312;The conflicts of agricultural water supply and demand under climate change in a typical arid land watershed of Central Asia;"Jiabin Peng a , Tie Liu b,* , Junxu Chen a,* , Zhengyang Li b,c , Yunan Ling b,c,d , Alain De Wulf d , Philippe De Maeyer d";"Study Focus the irrigated agriculture distributed in arid/ semi-arid areas is of great significance for food security and sustainable development. However, the shortage of water resources limits agricultural development in these areas, and the water distribution pattern under climate change is also uncertain. In this research, the Bosten Lake basin was selected as the study area, and the monthly agricultural water supply (AWS) and demand. (AWD) in the historical and future periods were evaluated. New Hydrological Insights for the Region supported by the hydrological model and evapotranspiration model, the AWS and AWD of the watershed were first evaluated. And 37 GCMs under CMIP6 were used to expand the study to future periods, a novel downscaling scheme consisting of IDW. BMA is used to increase the reliability of the results. The supply and demand of agricultural water in the future scenarios within the region are revealed. In the forthcoming future (the 2030 s), the watershed will maintain the warming and wetting trend in the historical period. In the long-term future (the 2060 s), agricultural water scarcity will become more severe, especially under the high emission scenario (ssp585). The adaption strategies to address climate change have also been proposed, and efficient water conveyance is highly recommended. This study is expected to provide a reference for water resources management in arid/semi-arid watersheds."
313;A system dynamics model analysis for policy impacts on green agriculture development: A case of the Sichuan Tibetan Area;"Wenke Wang a , Kang Li a,**, Yang Liu b,c,* , Jiayao Lian a , Shu Hong a";"Tibetan area of Sichuan Province is the green shelter for national ecological security, so the local agriculture should follow the path of green development rather than the traditional way. To develop green agriculture, proper policies need to be put forward. Therefore, it is necessary to simulate and test the policies proposed and see the long-term outcomes of implementing each policy before making the final decisions. The system dynamics model is a suitable way to simulate the impact of various policies on the development of green agriculture in the Sichuan Tibetan area from a dynamic and systematic perspective. Unlike existing studies that only consider unilateral policy impact, this paper conducts policy simulations from multiple aspects of population, investment and ecological environment. The simulation results showed that population policy and investment policy had a significant effect on improving the agricultural economic benefits. The agricultural output value will increase maximum of 2.8% if the population grows by 1.2% and more rural people are engaged in agricultural activities. The grain output will increase maximumly 9.8% if the sown area of crops increases by 1.2% each year and the investment in agricultural fixed assets increases by 2%. Green policy played a significant role in improving the ecological benefits of agriculture, and the maximum relative ratio of the green index of agricultural development was 12.2%. Finally, some suggestions are put forward, including government investment, protection of the agricultural ecological environment, and promotion of the agricultural market. It is anticipated that this system dynamic model and suggestions can contribute to the green development of agriculture in the Sichuan Tibetan area and other areas."
314;"Mapping soil salinity using a combination of vegetation index time series and single-temporal remote sensing images in the Yellow River Delta, China";"Bin Guo a , Xingchao Yang a , Maolin Yang a , Demao Sun a , Wangshuai Zhu b , Deyu Zhu b , Jianlin Wang c,d,";"Accurate mapping of soil salinity is of great significance for agricultural safety. However, soil salinity mapping has proven difficult because of its complex causes. The vegetation index (VI) time series has great potential in soil salinity mapping on a larger scale, yet studies on the use of this index are limited. Therefore, two inversion models (Model A and Model B) are established to assess the effects of VI time series on soil salinity mapping in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Model A is developed by combining VI time series and single-temporal remote sensing (RS) images, while Model B does not consider VI time series. The effects of VI time series are evaluated from several perspectives by comparing the performances of Model A and Model B. The results show that VI time series can improve the accuracy of soil salinity mapping. The accuracy of Model A (R2 = 0.80, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.4 mS cm- 1 ) is better than that of Model B (R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.68 mS cm- 1 ). In addition, the involvement of VI time series alleviates the overestimation of low-salinity soils and the underestimation of highsalinity soils, eliminating the dividing lines caused by different image times in soil salinity mapping. This study provides a large-scale, high spatial resolution (10 m), accurate soil salinity mapping method. It may help to maintain agricultural and ecological security and promote regional sustainable development."
315;Application of classification machine learning algorithms for characterizing nutrient transport in a clay plain agricultural watershed;"Ahmed Elsayed a,b,* , Sarah Rixon a , Jana Levison a , Andrew Binns a , Pradeep Goel";"Excess nutrients in surface water and groundwater can lead to water quality deterioration in available water resources. Thus, the classification of nutrient concentrations in water resources has gained significant attention during recent decades. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are considered an efficient tool to describe nutrient loss from agricultural land to surface water and groundwater. Previous studies have applied regression and classification ML algorithms to predict nutrient concentrations in surface water and/or groundwater, or to categorize an output variable using a limited number of input variables. However, there have been no studies that examined the application of different ML classification algorithms in agricultural settings to classify various output variables using a wide range of input variables. In this study, twenty-four ML classification algorithms were implemented on a dataset from three locations within the Upper Parkhill watershed, an agricultural watershed in southern Ontario, Canada. Nutrient concentrations in surface water were classified using geochemical and physical water parameters of surface water and groundwater (e.g., pH), climate and field conditions as the input variables. The performance of these algorithms was evaluated using four evaluation metrics (e.g., classification accuracy) to identify the optimal algorithm for classifying the output variables. Ensemble bagged trees was found to be the optimal ML algorithm for classifying nitrate concentration in surface water (accuracy of 90.9%), while the weighted KNN was the most appropriate algorithm for categorizing the total phosphorus concentration (accuracy of 87%). The ensemble subspace discriminant algorithm gave the highest overall classification accuracy for the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus and total dissolved phosphorus in surface water with an accuracy of 79.2% and 77.9%, respectively. This study exemplifies that ML algorithms can be used to signify exceedance of recommended concentrations of nutrients in surface waters in agricultural watersheds. Results are useful for decision makers to develop nutrient management strategies."
316;Education and agricultural household income: Comparative evidence from Vietnam and Thailand;"Dai Binh Tran a,* , Hanh Thi My Tran b , Thao Dinh Ngoc Pham a , Thuy Thanh Nguyen a";"Understanding the benefits of education is vital in formulating policy priorities, especially in developing countries. Without realizing how education affects income, the importance of education can be undervalued. This study investigates the impact of education on agricultural household income in Thailand and Vietnam by examining the Thailand Vietnam Socio-Economic Panel (TVSEP) dataset, which contains data on three provinces in each country. The random effects regression model is used to analyze the data. The findings show a positive correlation between education and income from crops and livestock and a negative correlation between education and income from both natural resource extraction and agricultural diversification. Additionally, heterogeneity in the influence of education on agricultural income across genders and ethnic groups is revealed. Even though Vietnam and Thailand are two of the largest rice exporters, being developing countries with limited farming technologies means that implications for relevant policy development are significant. Given the impact of education on the livelihood of farmers, investments in their education should be strongly encouraged to enhance their future agricultural income."
317;?How can we?? the need to direct research in digital agriculture towards capacities;"Julie Ingram * , Damian Maye";"Concerns about digital agriculture reinforcing industrialised models of agriculture and power inequalities have been widely articulated. This paper uses directionalities, which are characterised by dominant and durable directions or pathways, to conceptualise this envisaged entrenchment. It argues that we need to anticipate and collect the evidence on which to govern digital agriculture technologies before such directionalities set in. To support this anticipatory need, the paper draws on findings from a research prioritisation exercise with stakeholders in the UK. It identifies and critically analyses two interconnecting meta-themes, organisational capacity and human capacity, which emerged inductively in the analysis of selected themes and priority research questions. In doing this, the paper widens the scope of enquiry about digital agriculture, by introducing ?capacities? as a new theoretical lens to examine how institutional structures and processes shape the utilisation of digital data, technologies and their underlying directionalities. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of this new perspective on directionalities and capacities for digital agriculture research in the UK and internationally."

The AWF increased during 2002?2017. Meanwhile, the water footprint of cash crops rapidly increased from 10.08 billion m3 to 100.94 billion m3  however, the water footprint of grain production increased slowly and remained relatively stable. There were great differences in the water footprint of various agricultural products in twenty counties in the Hexi corridor. Furthermore, this study explored the equilibrium relationship between the gross domestic product (GDP), population, grain yield, fertilization, urbanization rate, and AWF using the Panel Pool Mean Group and autoregressive distributive lag (PMG/ARDL) model. Our findings demonstrated that economic growth, grain yield, and fertilization had a significant positive relationship with AWF, and population and the urbanization rate had a negative long-run but non-significant relationship with AWF. The panel causality analysis showed a oneway causal relationship between the AWF with population and urbanization rate. The grain yield, the rate of urbanization, and fertilization in the Hexi corridor need further improvements to ensure the sustainable development of water resources."
319;Remote sensing of swidden agriculture in the tropics: A review;"Ningsang Jiang, Peng Li *,1 , Zhiming Feng";"The evolution and transformations of swidden agriculture closely relate to ongoing studies of carbon budget, biological diversity, ecosystem services, indigenous wellbeing, and ethnic identities. Remote sensing has become an important tool to quantify and display swidden agriculture in transition. Due to its diversity, dynamics, and complexity, however, the development of universal remote sensing algorithms for mapping swidden agriculture faces major challenges. Although swidden agriculture has increasingly become the focus of climate change and other sustainable initiatives, a systematic review on remote sensing of this farming system in the tropics is seldom reported. With 89 peer-reviewed journal articles related to the identification, mapping, monitoring or forecast of swidden agriculture since the 1970s, the methodological progresses and shortcomings of remote sensing of swidden agriculture were compared and summarized, followed by providing several perspectives on near-future research directions. The conclusions were drawn as follows. Firstly, the limited remote sensing studies of swidden agriculture were mostly reported in Southeast Asia (66%), followed by Latin America and Central Africa. Secondly, Landsat is the most (59%) widely applied to monitor swidden agriculture and also holds huge potential in delineating its trajectories. Thirdly, the spectral feature-based algorithms (76%) are more used than the counterparts of geometric-based and structure-based ones. Finally, several aspects including exploring new data and algorithms for the enhancement of remote sensing of swidden agriculture have been proposed. This review paper might be served as a long-delayed appeal for strengthening remote sensing of swidden agriculture in the tropics for accurately assessing the carbon budget of forest change and other ecological and social effects caused by the evolution and transformations of swidden agriculture."
320;Perceived effects of climate policy on rural areas and agriculture: A rural-urban- divide;"Klaus Mittenzwei a,* , Geir W?ler Gustavsen b , Kristine Grimsrud c , Henrik Lindhjem d , Hilde Bj?khaug e";"Climate policies may have adverse geographically unequal socio-economic impacts that, if left unaddressed, may hamper their implementation. This paper examines factors explaining rural-urban perceptions of the effects of climate policy on agriculture and rural areas. The paper adds to current knowledge by jointly analysing socioeconomic factors and factors describing the distinct role geographical locations play in shaping these perceptions. We conduct a novel statistical analysis utilising a large preference survey of the Norwegian adult population spatially matched at the municipality level with indexes capturing centrality and the relative importance, and, hence, vulnerability of agriculture to effects of climate change. Our analysis does not identify a principal conflict between the goals of climate policy, rural policy, and agricultural policy across geographical locations. Conflicts along the rural-urban gradient arise around the priority given to the three policy areas, and the concrete impact of climate mitigation measures on rural areas. Centrality more than agricultural properties explains the formation of resistance to policies. The policy process should therefore acknowledge rural concerns, and climate mitigation options should be more carefully designed to avoid further rural-urban polarisation."
321;Advancing precision agriculture: The potential of deep learning for cereal plant head detection;"Alireza Sanaeifar a , Mahamed Lamine Guindo b , Adel Bakhshipour c , Hassan Fazayeli d , Xiaoli Li b,* , Ce Yang a,";"Cereal plant heads must be identified precisely and effectively in a range of agricultural applications, including yield estimation, disease detection, and breeding. Traditional methods that rely on manual feature extraction and thresholding take a lot of time and work, and they are also impacted by crop variability. Deep learning algorithms can be used to automate this procedure because they can directly extract complicated information from images and produce cutting-edge outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent research on deep learning-based head detection in cereal plants, emphasizing object detection and image segmentation. We also discuss the major benefits and drawbacks of different deep learning architectures and training methods, as well as examples of their application in maize, rice, wheat, and sorghum. Developing robust image processing algorithms, using deep learning in other domains like unmanned aerial vehicles, and utilizing large and diverse datasets are all challenges outlined in our study as future research directions. Through the integration of advanced computer vision techniques with precision agriculture, this paper attempts to promote further research and innovation in this intriguing field. We provide a thorough analysis of current developments in deep learningbased head detection for cereal plants and emphasize how this technology can contribute significantly to precision agriculture."
322;Dynamic parameterization of soil surface characteristics for hydrological models in agricultural catchments;"Thomas Grangeon a,* , Rosalie Vandromme a , Lai Ting Pak b,c , Philippe Martin d , Olivier Cerdan a , Jean-Baptiste Richet c , Olivier Evrard e , V?eronique Souch`ere f , Anne-V?eronique Auzet g , Bruno Ludwig h , Jean-Fran?is Ouvry c";"The detrimental impacts of surface runoff and soil erosion, particularly in cultivated areas, call for the use of distributed runoff and soil erosion models with a view to supporting adapted catchment management strategies. However, runoff model parameterization remains challenging in agricultural catchments due to the high spatial and seasonal variability of soil properties. Data acquisition is demanding and may not always be feasible. Therefore, model parameterization in such environments have been the subject of numerous research efforts. The combined analysis of land use management and soil surface state was proposed in literature to address this issue and demonstrated its potential for runoff analysis and modelling. However, these research findings were related to specific rainfall sequences and/or soil surface state. In this study, existing knowledge on soil surface state and its application to runoff model parameterization were synthetized and included in an easy-to-use parameterization software (PREMACHE), providing a framework for modelers lacking of means and/or data for modelling complex agricultural catchments. To develop and evaluate the software, a dataset was acquired over 9 years on more than 110 plots in a 1045 ha agricultural catchment, including crop types, soil surface state, rainfall and runoff time series. Soil surface state dynamics was modeled based on crop types and daily rainfall. It was evaluated in the experimental catchment and validated in a nearby catchment. Soil hydrodynamic properties (e.g. infiltration capacity) were deduced from this framework and literature data at a daily time step, for each plots. Moreover, runoff events were measured when the modeled infiltration capacity was low, indicating that the parametrization adequately captured its temporal dynamics. The software developed in this study, as well as setup values deduced from the monitoring campaigns are provided with the manuscript for application in other ungauged catchments and explore their impact on agricultural catchment hydrological dynamics."
323;Short and long-term volatility transmission from oil to agricultural commodities e The robust quantile regression approach;"Dejan Zivkov  a, *, Slavica Manic b , Jasmina ?uraskovic c";"This paper investigates permanent and transitory spillover effects from Brent oil futures to four agricultural futures e corn, wheat, soybean and canola. We construct permanent and transitory volatilities via component GARCH model, considering six different distribution functions. Created volatility time-series are embedded in the robust quantile regression framework. Transitory effect from oil market has slightly stronger influence on the agricultural commodities than its permanent counterpart, which is a sign that short-term information flow has more intense effect than fundamental factors. The results indicate that the best diversification instrument in combination with oil is soybean futures, since it is the least subject to oil volatility shocks."

Vapor Pressure Deficit is one of the ET parameters that has a significant impact on its calculation (VPD). This paper forecasts VPD using ensemble learning-based modeling in eight different regions (Dakahliyah, Gharbiyah, Kafr Elsheikh, Dumyat, Port Said, Ismailia, Sharqiyah, and Qalubiyah) in Egypt. In this study, six machine learning algorithms were used: Linear Regression (LR), Additive regression trees (ART), Random SubSpace (RSS), Random Forest (RF), Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree), and Quinlan?s M5 algorithm (M5P). Monthly vapor pressure data were obtained from the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis JRA-55 from 1958 to 2021. The dateset has been divided into two segments: the training stage (1958?2005) and the testing stage (2006?2021). Five statistical measures were used to evaluate the model performances: Correlation Coefficient (CC), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Relative absolute error (RAE), and Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE), across both training and testing stages. RF model outperformed the rest of the models [CC = 0.9694 MAE = 0.0967 RMSE = 0.1252 RAE (%) = 21.7297 and RRSE (%) = 24.0356], followed closely by REPTree and RSS models. On the other hand, M5P model performance remained moderate and both LR and AR model were the worst. During the testing stage, RF outperformed the rest of the models in terms of (which statistic), followed closely by REPTree and RSS models. On the other hand, M5P performance remained moderate and both LR and AR models were the worst. This study recommended using the RF model for future hydro-climatological studies in general, and vapor pressure deficit modeling and prediction in particular. This study enables future magnitudes to be predicted, alerting the authorities and administrators involved to focus their policy-making on more specific pathways toward climate adaptation."
325;"Agriculture systems dataset in rural communities of Hidalgo state, Mexico";Yaxk?in Coronado;"The agricultural systems are commonly underrepresented by the decision making, due to difficulties obtaining data in the rural work, so then we collect data corresponding to a socio-economic and environmental survey applied to understand the relations between agricultural production, household economy, small stakeholders family structure, corn production and associated crops, and producers siblings acquiring sites of foods, edible plants and animals. The information was obtained by a survey applied to a rural population with high and very high poverty conditions into municipalities of Ixmiquilpan and El Cardonal in Hidalgo state at the center of Mexico. We performed a statistical analysis to identify the main socio-economic, agricultural and household characteristics in order to show an scope of the agricultural situation and household of rural agricultural communities in Hidalgo. This information allows us to design a recommendation for access to financial support or technical assistance in order to improve their production according to their sociocultural conditions. The data include socioeconomic values that are statistically representative of the official governmental values, proving the sufficiency of data and reproducible form in order to compare this data to other agricultural systems reported in Mexico. In the future a temporal comparison with federal data is desirable."
326;Water quality and interaction between groundwater and surface water impacted by agricultural activities in an oasis-desert region;"Weihua Wang a,b , Yaning Chen a,b,* , Wanrui Wang c,d , Chenggang Zhu a,b , Yapeng Chen a,b , Xigang Liu a,e , Tianju Zhang a,e";"A comprehensive understanding of groundwater dynamics and its interaction with surface water under the influence of agricultural activities is essential for local agriculture, ecology and resident in arid regions, which is poorly understood in arid oasis-desert region. In our study, with emphasis on a comparison of hydrogeochemical characteristics between the oasis (irrigated) and desert (non-irrigated) areas, the water quality and groundwatersurface water interaction of a typical oasis-desert system with a rapid irrigation agriculture development were examined to clarify the effects of agricultural activities on groundwater level and quality using stable isotopic and hydrochemical data of 83 water samples. Results showed that cultivated land area increased by 121.8 % (732.4 km2 ) during 2000 to 2020, mainly transferring from grassland and bare land. Groundwater EC ranged from 786 to 49,400 ?S/cm, with weakly alkaline. Shallow groundwater had a much higher EC than other water components. Stable isotopic and EC values of shallow groundwater in the non-irrigation areas were much greater than those in the irrigation areas, whereas middle groundwater isotopic values were more depleted in the desert than in the oasis. Shallow groundwater EC value was lower in summer, middle groundwater had higher EC in summer. Streamflow and confined water in the study area are suitable for agricultural irrigation, but phreatic water in the oasis is generally not suitable for irrigation at present. The groundwater chemistry was mainly controlled by strong evaporation, dilution, mixing, water-rock interaction and agricultural drainage. Groundwater in the irrigation areas was recharged by ephemeral runoff seepage, irrigation return flow and subsurface lateral inflow. Long-term development of irrigation agriculture (large-scale land reclamation, irrigation and groundwater pumping) in arid region has caused groundwater level decline and salinization, with a strong interaction between phreatic water and surface water. Hence, decreasing irrigation area and groundwater exploitation, carrying out gradual ecological restoration, improving water-saving efficiency and agricultural drainage system would be the viable method to restore groundwater and maintain the oasis-desert ecosystem coexistence in arid regions in the context of climate change."
327;The aging of farmers and its challenges for labor-intensive agriculture in China: A perspective on farmland transfer plans for farmers? retirement;"Jianzhi Liu a , Yangang Fang a,b,* , Gang Wang c , Bencheng Liu d , Ruru Wang a";"As a major labor-intensive agricultural producer globally, China is facing a rapidly aging farming population and a persistent exodus of young farmers. There are no clear answers to the questions of how China?s labor-intensive agriculture will be shaped by these challenges and what future changes will occur. Exploring the agricultural practices of older farmers and the farmland transfer plans (FTPs) of farmers for retirement and the associated mechanisms is important for answering these questions. Thus, we construct an explanatory framework for FTPs using a nested structure consisting of factors at 3 levels, macrocontext, meso-region, and microindividual, and conduct an empirical study based on a field survey of two villages with specialized fruit and vegetable cultivation in China. The results demonstrate the negative effects of an aging farming population on labor-intensive agricultural production, returns, and risk resistance capacities. While macrolevel contextual characteristics in China determine the widespread psychological rejection of farming by the young generation, the interaction of objective factors, including their education level, jobs, wages and their family?s agricultural resources and farming practices, shapes the individual heterogeneity in intergenerational farmland transfer plans moreover, location and geography are among the core factors affecting the regional differences in FTPs. Finally, this paper envisions multiple possible trajectories of China?s labor-intensive agriculture and the corresponding geographical patterns under the challenges of the aging of farmers."
328;New perspectives on the agriculture?migration nexus;"Russell King a,* , Aija Lulle b , Emilia Melossi c";"In this introductory article to the special issue on ?Agricultural Regimes and Migrant Labour?, we first propose the analytical concept of the ?agriculture?migration nexus?. This is made up of a series of causal and co-constructive links between specialised agriculture, on the one hand, and seasonal and temporary regimes of migrant labour on the other. In the second part of the paper we identify a number of cross-cutting themes which resonate across the papers that make up the special issue. These include new geographical patterns of agricultural labour migration, especially in Europe a focus on specialised agricultural districts involving the intensive production of crops such as tomatoes and strawberries the disciplining function of time, inscribed into regimes of seasonal migrant labour and daily work rhythms and moral questions surrounding the justification for agricultural labour exploitation and how it can be challenged. The final section of the article presents highlights from the eight substantive papers that follow, demonstrating how they are logically sequenced and integrated as a whole."
329;Research on the optimal allocation of agricultural water and soil resources in the Heihe River Basin based on SWAT and intelligent optimization;"Zepeng Zhang, Qingzheng Wang, Qingyu Guan * , Xiong Xiao, Jimin Mi, Songjian Lv";"In the context of global climate change, changes in precipitation and temperature conditions, especially the increasing frequency of extreme climate events, have a severe impact on agricultural production. Predicting climate change and adjusting planting structures over time are critical to sustainable agricultural development. In this study, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models were used to simulate the future climate and runoff in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin (MHR). Then, the MOPSO and NSGA-II were used to plan future planting structures. The results showed that the temperature and precipitation in the MHR showed an increasing trend. By the 2070 s, the temperature was projected to increase by more than 2 ?C under SSP245, while that under SSP585 was more than 4 ?C. The annual mean precipitation was projected to increase, but the distribution was uneven, and the increased precipitation was mainly concentrated in spring and autumn. Under the interaction of temperature and precipitation, the runoff of the Heihe River will increase in the future, especially under SSP585, and the runoff of the Heihe River is projected to reach 2.48 billion m3 /a in the 2070 s. Crop water demand was projected to increase with temperature, and crop irrigation water demand would increase by 14.4 % in the 2070 s under SSP245. Planting vegetables helps to improve agricultural economic benefits and carbon sinks, but to control soil erosion, the area of vegetables is best kept at approximately 16 %. Fertilizers and agricultural films are the primary carbon sources in agricultural production activities in MHR, accounting for more than 60 % of the total carbon. This study suggests promoting sustainable agricultural development by improving irrigation efficiency, using low-carbon fertilizers, controlling soil erosion, and gradually expanding the vegetable planting area with a considered ecological environment."
330;Assessing the impacts of meteorological factors on soybean production in China: What role can agricultural subsidy play?;"Abbas Ali Chandio a,* , Waqar Akram b , Ghulam Raza Sargani a , Martinson Ankrah Twumasi a , Fayyaz Ahmad c,";"Cereal and oilseed crops possess significance in meeting global food security. China, housing the most number of people, remains the top importer of oilseed crops (i.e., soybeans) to produce energy and meet its food needs. With such significance, the present study investigates the impact of meteorological factors on soybean production in China using the annual data from 1978 to 2020. It also incorporated other essential determinants of soybean production, such as agricultural subsidy, cultivated area, and fertilizer use. For data analysis, it employed the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method and the Quantile Regression (QR) technique. The findings from an ARDL model unveiled meteorological factors such as the yearly average temperature and CO2 emissions declined soybean production in the long?run and short?run analysis, whereas the yearly average precipitation improved soybean production. Besides, agricultural subsidy, cultivated area, and fertilizer use also enhanced soybean production in the long?and short?run analyses. In addition, the findings from the Quantile Regression (QR) technique showed that temperature and CO2 emissions negatively affected soybean production in each quantile (i.e., 0.1?0.90), while precipitation and agricultural subsidy positively augmented soybean production across all quantiles (i.e., 0.1?0.90). Based on these results, the study provides clear policy implications, such as governments should provide crop-specific subsidies instead of input-based subsidies to embolden the impact of agricultural subsidies. Also, ecological improvement campaigns should be launched to attract farmers attention to sustainable agriculture practices to meet meteorological challenges."
331;Utilization of biomass for energy conservation in agricultural usage;"Shrikant Madhukar Deshmukh a,b,* , Muhammad Imran Shekh a,b , Kulbhushan Samal b , Sachin Rameshrao Geed c , Amit Ganguly b";"Ensuring food security is a crucial sustainable development goal in developing countries such as India. One of the major challenges is affordable storage infrastructure for food preservation. The high cost of storage facilities is due to expensive insulating materials. In this study, we explored the potential of agricultural biomass, which is often burned, as a low-cost sustainable insulating material for energy conservation in cold storage technologies. We investigated the efficacy of biomass as a heat insulating medium and compared its transmission losses with conventional polyurethane foam (PUF). The biomass characterization results showed that the thermal conductivity of paddy straw biomass was 0.0670 W/m?C, with the lowest conductivity observed for 1?2 mm sized biomass particles. By demonstrating the potential of agricultural biomass as an affordable and sustainable insulating material, this study contributes to the development of cost-effective storage solutions, ultimately benefiting farmers and supporting food security efforts in developing countries."

However, data collection from official representative sources is complex, and often they require subsequent treatment to be transformed into meaningful inventory data. This article shows a comprehensive dataset for obtaining inventory data and developing an environmental life cycle impact assessment of representative agricultural production corresponding to reference holdings at a regional level (NUTS 2) in Spain. The dataset comprises Excel files with the data compiled from secondary sources to be used in the assessment and the R code scripts to transform the data into relevant inventory data to estimate the environmental impacts of the reference holdings. This dataset is a reliable tool for researchers and other potential users to be used as a secondary information source for further studies. It can also be used to estimate the environmental impacts of the farming activity of agri-food products in other regions or countries by collecting similar data for the specific region and adjusting the R code."

Evidence from China;"Zhiqiang Cheng a , Zheng Zhu a , Haijing Zhang b, Huilin Liu c";"As global climate change intensifies, reducing agricultural losses due to weather disasters caused by climate change has become a major concern. This study follows a cohort DID framework to explore the effects and mechanisms of early disaster experience on farmers household agricultural income using the China Family Panel Studies data. This study finds that farmer households exposed to extreme disaster shocks early in life perform better in household agricultural income, but there are heterogeneities across households due to differences in resource endowments. Households with easier access to weather information, higher levels of cognition among household members, higher levels of household assets, better social capital, and less availability of nonfarm employment opportunities performed better. Furthermore, climate change adaptive behavior is the main channel through which early disaster experiences affect household agricultural income. Households that experienced disaster shocks in earlier years tend to implement climate change adaptive behaviors such as reducing land rent out, increasing land rent in, and reducing participation in non-farm employment to increase household agricultural income. These findings provide evidence for farmers to adapt to climate change by learning from their disaster experiences. It also provides a reference for relevant authorities to design policies to help farmers adapt to climate change."
335;Effect of farmland cost on the scale efficiency of agricultural production based on farmland price deviation;"Yuan Qi a , Jiaqing Zhang a , Xin Chen b , Yaoyao Li a , Yuyang Chang c , Daolin Zhu a,d,";"The relationship between agricultural production factor prices and production performance has long been a topic of academic discussion. However, current research has paid relatively little attention to the problem of scale efficiency losses in agricultural production caused by deviations in farmland prices. In order to explore the development direction needed to improve China?s agricultural competitiveness, we analyzed the deviation mechanism of farmland prices in China and the loss of scale efficiency of agricultural production due to high farmland prices, starting from the perspective of farmland price deviation. Accordingly, based on 1188 microfarm household survey samples, a threshold regression model was used to provide empirical support for our theoretical analysis in two dimensions: full samples and differentiation of farmland use types. The empirical results show that the problem of high farmland prices prevails throughout China, with the mean farmland price deviation (abbreviated as DEV) in Chinese provinces reaching 1.42, and it is especially high in Shandong (1.88), Henan (1.67), and Heilongjiang (1.59). The deviation is mainly caused by China?s special resource endowment and farming culture. At the same time, the current scale efficiency of agricultural production in Chinese provinces is inadequate, with a mean value of only 0.70, and approximately 65% of farmers? actual input size is significantly lower than the optimal input size. The threshold effect test shows that the effect of farmland cost increase on agricultural production scale efficiency exhibits a structural shift from promoting to inhibiting as the degree of farmland price changes from low to high. In particular, in the scenario of overpriced farmland (DEV = 1.16), farmland cost increase inhibits the growth of China?s agricultural production scale efficiency. In addition, there is heterogeneity across farmland uses, with grain crops being more likely to be scale-efficient (0.74) than nongrain crops (0.62). The threshold regression results between the grain and nongrain groups further reveal that in the high farmland price scenario, grain crops are more severely inhibited by the rising cost of farmland than nongrain crops. Ultimately, we propose an optimal solution to improve the performance of agricultural production in China in two dimensions: reducing farmland cost and promoting service scale operation."
336;"Freshwater competition among agricultural, industrial, and municipal sectors in a water-scarce country. Lessons of Pakistan?s fifty-year development of freshwater consumption for other water-scarce countries";"A.W. Siyal a,b,* , P.W. Gerbens-Leenes a , S.D. Vaca-Jim?enez a,c";"Agriculture, industry and municipal water supply compete over scarce freshwater. This study calculated sectoral blue water footprints (WFs) in water scarce Pakistan between 1971 and 2020. Agriculture dominates blue WFs, industry contributed 0.5?1.4%, municipal WFs 0.5?1.7%. Manufacture (cloth and yarn) and electricity production (hydropower) dominated blue industrial WFs. Agricultural crop and livestock production tripled using the same amount of blue water, but industrial and municipal WFs increased with increasing production/population, the blue industrial WF by a factor of 3.3, municipal WFs by a factor of 3.6. Pakistan?s water scarcity depends on environmental flow requirement (EFR) definitions. Volumetric government definitions generate low water scarcity allocating almost all water to society. Higher EFR?s generate moderate to severe scarcity. Efficient agriculture leaves more water for industry and municipal supply, increasing crop output and decreasing sectoral competition. Policy might support improved water infrastructure. Pakistan?s lessons are relevant for other water scarce countries."
337;"The complex interplay between plant-microbe and virus interactions in sustainable agriculture: Harnessing phytomicrobiomes for enhanced soil health, designer plants, resource use efficiency, and food security";"Ashim Das Astapati a , Soumitra Nath b";"The present-day climate change scenario represents a substantial peril to the global population concerning food security, given the potential impacts on agricultural productivity, food availability, and accessibility. The excessive use of agrochemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, leads to the deterioration of soil health as well. Sustainable land-use practices without perturbing the soil ecosystem are achievable only with a comprehensive mechanism. The current need for sustainable agriculture is fulfilled by harnessing the noble services of plantmicrobial association. Microhabitats around plant roots represent the region of maximum microbial activity. Microbiomes play a functional role in affecting plant growth, soil fertility and biogeochemical cycles. Plantmicrobe interactions are highly specific to the host controlled by root exudates, metabolites, environmental factors and symbiotic associations e.g. legume-rhizobia and plant-fungi association. Proper strategies for the use of microbial inoculants will certainly facilitate the various crop improvement programs. The present review, therefore, exemplifies the various studies on the potential of plant microbiomes for sustainable agricultural ecosystems coupled with assuring food security. The review also summarizes recent trends in plant microbiome diversity, the relationship between host plant and microbe, transgenic plants, designer plants and their role in mitigating soil stress. Nevertheless, the future of the global population and food production rely on the prospects of plant microbiome ingenuity"
338;A trusted IoT data sharing and secure oracle based access for agricultural production risk management;"Manoj T., Krishnamoorthi Makkithaya * , Narendra V.G.";"Agricultural risks associated with weather events, soil conditions, diseases, and pests have risen in recent years due to climate change. These risks have burdened farmers with the shock of financial stress and endangered the region?s food security. Despite increasing risks, notable risk management tools like agricultural insurance have not effectively reached marginal farmers in developing economies. This can be attributed to the fact that existing centralized agricultural information systems lack trust factors in sharing and accessing agricultural risk data, which is accompanied by processing delays in insurance payouts. To this end, the emergence of promising technologies like blockchain helps establish trust and automates insurance-based payments with smart contracts. This work proposes a framework called AgriSSIOracle with two key contributions. The first is to have a trusted agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) data sharing that employs blockchain-based SelfSovereign Identity (SSI) and provable credentials. Second is the decentralized oracle-based access control mechanism for smart contracts in agricultural insurance. A method for privacy-preserved authentication and data provenance for agricultural IoT devices is developed with SSI-based Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Next, the IoT data sharing scheme is illustrated using publish?subscribe and request?response communication patterns based on the device data credentials. Finally, the decentralized oracle mechanism for smart contracts is built based on multiparty computation for risk-related data access. The implementation of the framework is realized using a permissioned identity blockchain called Hyperledger Indy and Ethereum, which is a public blockchain for smart contracts. The security and privacy analysis confirms that the AgriSSIOracle framework ensures trust factors, particularly authenticity, privacy, data provenance, data integrity, and access control. The framework is evaluated with respect to the transaction throughput, latency, credential issue-verify-revoke time, and resource utilization metrics. The evaluation results prove that the AgriSSIOracle solution is scalable and efficient and meets the requirements of real-time deployment."
339;The development of multifunctional agriculture in farming regions of China: Convergence or divergence?;"Yingnan Zhang a , Hualou Long b,c,* , Shuocun Chen a , Li Ma d , Muye Gan e";"The multifunctionality paradigm, in particular, represented a facilitator of sustainable agricultural development. There arises a question of whether or not the different areas would evolve in a common direction. This study attempts to examine the dynamics and performances of multifunctional agriculture (MFA) in farming regions of China by using the multi-criteria comprehensive appraisal method and convergence analysis. The integrated function and multifunctionality of agriculture in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain are assessed, based on which the evolving trend is investigated. The findings reveal that from 1990 to 2015, the multifunctionality of agriculture in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain was strengthened, displaying clear agglomeration in larger metropolitan regions, which has been a characteristic of MFA in regions with a thriving economy. The supply function for agricultural products arose during 1990?2000, then maintained steady, while suffering a recession in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration and Jiaodong Peninsula. The function of social security generally continued to increase, presenting a spatially surging trend from north to south and from east to west. The function of facilitating agricultural economic development was also enhanced, especially in the clusters including the Beijing-Tianjin urban agglomeration, the Jiaodong Peninsula, and the northern Jiangsu Province. The function of ecological conservation displayed obvious spatial heterogeneity, and the functional index manifests no apparent variation. The s coefficients of each functional index indicate that path dependence, which excludes the function of social security when there are regional disparities, is a crucial characteristic of the evolution process of the MFA subdimensions. Areas with low multifunctionality do not grow faster than areas with high multifunctionality, and they are differentiated in terms of their performance. The ?catch-up effect? is clearly apparent when external forces intervene, as evidenced by the absolute and conditional ? convergence. These findings have important ramifications for the creation of policies that, in line with the market rationality of territorial division, encouraging MFA in peri-urban and economically developed areas while fostering large-scale and industrialized farming in distant areas."
340;Key technologies and applications of agricultural energy Internet for agricultural planting and fisheries industry;"Xueqian Fu a,b,c,d, * , Haosen Niu a";"Energy consumption in the agricultural sector is significant, reaching 20% of the total energy consumption in China. Agricultural Energy Internet, an important extension of Energy Internet in the agricultural field, significantly contributes to agricultural modernization. Key technologies of Agricultural Energy Internet are vital factors supporting its development. This article systematically reviews the key technologies of Agricultural Energy Internet for two areas: agriculture and fishery. The working mechanisms and power consumption characteristics of some state-of-the-art new-energy agricultural intelligent equipment are described. In addition, the principles and profit methods underlying the agro-industrial complementary operation model are introduced. Moreover, against the Agricultural Energy Internet background, the development trends of some state-of-theart new energy agricultural intelligent equipment, agro-industrial complementary, and carbon?neutral technology are proposed in this paper, providing novel perspectives on the promotion of the development of Agricultural Energy Internet and related technological innovation research. An unmanned farm is the main form of the future agricultural system, which is powered by the Agricultural Energy Internet based on smart agriculture and a smart grid. It will become the inevitable trend of modern agriculture to replace oil agriculture with electric farms. The electricity in farming is mainly generated by renewable energy. Renewable energy power generation has low carbon emissions and is the future direction for the development of agricultural energy systems. In addition, the Internet of Things will be further strengthened to realize automation and intelligence of agricultural energy systems."
341;"A novel approach to vulnerability assessment for adaptation planning in agriculture: An application to the Lower Bhavani Irrigation Project, India";"Ambili G. Kamalamma a,b , Mukand S. Babel a,* , Venkataramana Sridhar c , Geethalakshmi Vellingiri d,";"The global discourse on climate change adaptation in various sectors has largely taken a top-down approach. However, impact analysis based on top-down approach with uncertainties at every stage of the process may lead to poor adaptation responses and hence there is a need for an alternative to this conventional approach. This study aims to implement a bottom-up, risk-based approach to vulnerability assessment in the agriculture sector, by adapting the Climate Risk Informed Decision Analysis (CRIDA) approach. This paper explains the risks that climate variability and change pose to the agricultural system, with Lower Bhavani Irrigation Project in the South India as a case study. The climate stressors of aridity index and climate variability were incremented or perturbed to develop different future climate scenarios, and the changes in paddy yield and supply?demand ratio were examined. The supply?demand relationship in the system was highly vulnerable to the aggregate effects of climate variability and change, whereas the risk to paddy yield was low. Since the change in crop water demand induces risk to the system, we recommend planning demand management measures such as changes in cropping calendar, system of rice intensification, alternate wet and dry irrigation, deficit irrigation etc. to minimize the impacts. As the range of projections in climate variables is large, and the yield responses are low, we recommend having both robust and flexible adaptation plans. The bottom-up approach presented here provides solutions relevant to the system, hence it is highly suitable and recommended for local adaptation planning in agriculture sector."
342;"A comprehensive and global evaluation of residual antibiotics in agricultural soils: Accumulation, potential ecological risks, and attenuation strategies";"Linfa Fang a,b , Chengyu Chen c , ShiYang Li a , Pingping Ye a , Yujia Shi a , Gaurav Sharma d , Binoy Sarkar e , Sabry M. Shaheen f,g,d,* , Sang Soo Lee h,**, Ran Xiao a,b,***, Xinping Chen a,b";"The occurrence of antibiotics in agricultural soils has raised concerns due to their potential risks to ecosystems and human health. However, a comprehensive understanding of antibiotic accumulation, distribution, and potential risks to terrestrial ecosystems on a global scale is still limited. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the accumulation of antibiotics and their potential risks to soil microorganisms and plants, and highlighted the driving factors of antibiotic accumulation in agricultural soils based on 134 peer-reviewed studies (between 2000 and 2022). The results indicated that 56 types of antibiotics were detected at least once in agricultural soils with concentrations ranging from undetectable to over 7000 ?g/kg. Doxycycline, tylosin, sulfamethoxazole, and enrofloxacin, belonging to the tetracyclines, macrolides, sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones, respectively, were the most accumulated antibiotics in agricultural soil. The accumulation of TCs, SAs, and FQs was found to pose greater risks to soil microorganisms (average at 29.3%, 15.4%, and 21.8%) and plants (42.4%, 26.0%, and 38.7%) than other antibiotics. East China was identified as a hot spot for antibiotic contamination due to high levels of antibiotic concentration and ecological risk to soil microorganisms and plants. Antibiotic accumulation was found to be higher in vegetable fields (245.5 ?g/kg) and orchards (212.4 ?g/kg) compared to croplands (137.2 ?g/kg). Furthermore, direct land application of manure resulted in a greater accumulation of TCs, SAs, and FQs accumulation in soils than compost fertilization. The level of antibiotics decreased with increasing soil pH and organic matter content, attributed to decreasing adsorption and enhancing degradation of antibiotics. In conclusion, this study highlights the need for further research on the impacts of antibiotics on soil ecological function in agricultural fields and their interaction mechanisms. Additionally, a whole-chain approach, consisting of antibiotic consumption reduction, manure management strategies, and remediation technology for soil contaminated with antibiotics, is needed to eliminate the potential environmental risks of antibiotics for sustainable and green agriculture."
343;Characterization of agricultural drought propagation over China based on bivariate probabilistic quantification;"Yang Xu a , Xuan Zhang a,* , Zengchao Hao a , Vijay P. Singh b , Fanghua Hao a";"Agricultural drought has become a serious threat to the world food security and sustainable development. Although various characteristics have been investigated for agricultural drought assessment and early warning, the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought is less than clear. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variations of characteristics of the propagation from meteorological drought to agricultural drought over China during the period of 1953?2012. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Soil moisture Index (SSI) were used to characterize meteorological drought and agricultural drought, respectively. The SSI-1 and SPI-m (1?12) were chosen as drought propagation series by correlation analysis to evaluate the correlation and propagation time between these two droughts. The probability of propagation in different regions of China was quantified using copula-based models. Results indicated that the strongest and the weakest correlations between meteorological drought and agricultural drought were found in summer (0.8?0.9) and in winter (0.5?0.8), respectively, while the propagation time increased from 1 to 2 months in summer to 2?7 months in the next spring. Spatially, correlation and propagation sensitivity between meteorological drought and agricultural drought were greater in humid areas than in other climatic zones. Further, the probability of agricultural drought occurrence was found to synchronously increase with the severity of meteorological drought. This study will help improve drought warning and forecasting systems."
344;Public money for public goods: The role of ideas in driving agriculture policy in the EU and post-Brexit UK;"Hermann Kam * , Heather Smith, Clive Potter";"The role played by concepts and ideas in driving policy transformations has been much discussed in the political science literature. This paper presents a case study of ideas and the extent to which they drive policy change, drawing on the example of the Public Money for Public Goods (PMPG) principle in relation to the reform of EU and UK agriculture policy. We assess the factors which have promoted the adoption of the PMPG principle and the extent to which it is currently being realised under the EU?s Common Agricultural Policy and the UK?s postBrexit agriculture policies. Drawing on a range of expert interviews, we find that policy concepts such as this have the capacity to be utilised by policymakers when looking to solve ?wicked? policy problems, and once mobilised, can gradually gain acceptance amongst stakeholders, lobbyists and policymakers over time. However, we also report evidence of dilution and mission creep, with a gap emerging between the original idea, its interpretation, and how it is realised in the messy world of policy advocacy and resistance. We conclude that advocates of the PMPG principle need to seize some recent windows of opportunities under an emerging set of post-Brexit set of land management schemes to further develop and implement this important policy idea."
345;Forty-year spatio-temporal dynamics of agricultural climate suitability in China reveal shifted major crop production areas;"Yuxin Pan a , Ren Yang a,b,* , Jianxiu Qiu a , Jieyong Wang c , Jiapei Wu a";"Studies measuring climate change effects on crop production and development usually focus on extreme temperature and heat indicators while ignoring water requirements and land suitability. In this study, spatially continuous differences in climate data from 1980 to 2017 using meteorological station data and elevation data as covariates were analysed with the ANUSPLIN software. The analysis integrated the effects of water and thermal resources on the agricultural production layout. Cover remote sensing of China?s multi-period land use showed that the centre of gravity of the suitable planting area of winter wheat, spring maize, and medium rice has changed according to climate conditions. It is anticipated that other arable land reserve resources, including unused lands, grasslands, and forest land, in sensitive areas such as the Taklamakan Desert, Loess Plateau, and Hexi Corridor could be rationally developed. This study provides valuable references for agricultural zoning adjustment and agricultural development policy formulation."
346;Intra-gendered perceptions and adoption of climate-smart agriculture: Evidence from smallholder farmers in the Upper East Region of Ghana;"Kwabena Antwi a,b,* , Philip Antwi-Agyei a";"Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) remains a key strategy for sustaining agricultural systems and achieving food security and nutrition. Despite this, uncertainty remains on how intra-gendered dynamics influence its adoption in dryland farming systems. This study implements both quantitative and qualitative approaches including household surveys, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions to explore how intra-gender dynamics shape the perceptions and adoption of climate-smart agriculture in three selected communities (Katanga, Dakio, and Zonno) in the Bolgatanga East District of the Upper East Region of Ghana. Specifically, the study answers the following research questions: (i) What is the degree of change in rainfall and temperature in the Bolgatanga East District? (ii) How does gender shape the perception of smallholder farmers on climate variability in the study communities? (iii) Which CSA interventions are employed by smallholder farming households in the study communities? (iv) Which socio-demographic factors influence intra-gendered perceptions and adoption of CSA in the study communities? Binary logistic regression was used to identify the factors influencing male and female farmers? perceptions and adoption of climate-smart agriculture. Rainfall and temperature trends from 2010 to 2020 were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall trend test. We found that over the past ten years, smallholder farmers in the district have seen rising temperatures and erratic rainfall patterns. Less educated female smallholder farmers adopted CSA interventions relative to more educated female farmers. Married male smallholder farmers employed CSA interventions on their farms compared to single and divorced male farmers. The adoption of CSA was higher for female farmers with inherited farmland than for those with rented land. Our results indicate that the source of income and farming experience influence male smallholder farmers? adoption of crop rotation and their decision to diversify crops on their farms. The farmland tenure system, farming experience, and income source of female farmers influence their choice to change planting dates. The study recommends the integration of intra-gendered dynamics in policy reforms to reduce the vulnerability of smallholder farmers with different socioeconomic characteristics to climate variability in Ghana."
347;A bibliometric analysis on drought and heat indices in agriculture;"Flora De Natale * , Roberta Alilla, Barbara Parisse, Pierfrancesco Nardi";"Under the ongoing global warming, drought and heat extreme events are increasing in frequency and intensity. While adversely affecting the environment, these changes will have inevitable socioeconomic consequences. By combining bibliometric science mapping and break-point analyses to synthetize the global research published on drought and heat indices applied in agriculture in the 1950?2022 period, the present study provides a first comprehensive view of this research theme. Bibliometric analyses were applied to a set of 4,948 scientific publications retrieved from the Elsevier?s Scopus and the Web of Science databases. The results identified 5 different research fields of applications of these indices concerning drought analysis at different time scales, climate change risk, drought effects at crop/plant level, water resource management and drought monitoring from remote sensing. Through a break-point analysis, three sub-periods of scientific literature were identified with different publication rate and the main changes in research interest were highlighted. A total of 124 drought and 20 heat indices reported in the bibliographic dataset were detected and analyzed in terms of number of occurrences and research impact. The most utilized indices are SPI and CWSI, both droughtrelated, but their research impact is currently overcome by other indices such as, for example, SSWI, MIDI and OSAVI, mainly based on remote sensing data. Furthermore, this study showed a change of focus from crop/field to large scale, over the assessed period, also due to the availability of new data sources mainly derived from remote sensing, together with an increasing weight of terms like impact, climate change, scenario, and trend, which highlights the need to address these challenges from a global perspective."
348;A statistical model of land use/cover change integrating logistic and linear models: An application to agricultural abandonment;"Ian Estacio a,* , Corinthias P.M. Sianipar a,b , Kenichiro Onitsuka a , Mrittika Basu a , Satoshi Hoshino a";"Several land use/cover change (LUCC) models have been developed to simulate future LUCC. However, current models work with the assumption that the input non-spatial variables are significant to the LUCC in hand and there is still a lack of model that could identify which non-spatial variables are significant drivers of LUCC. This paper presents a statistical model of LUCC that integrates a logistic model based on spatial drivers and a linear model based on non-spatial drivers. The logistic model produces a probability map that represents local probabilities of LUCC while the linear model produces a global probability threshold that represents a global probability of LUCC, and by comparing the two variables, LUCC is mapped. The statistical model was utilized to model agricultural abandonment in the Ifugao rice terraces, Philippines. Statistical modeling identified the significant spatial and non-spatial drivers of agricultural abandonment in the terraces. Accuracy assessment showed that simulated maps achieved accuracies suitable for LUCC simulation, demonstrating that the statistical model can be a potential tool for prediction of future LUCC."
349;Dynamic path planning method for headland turning of unmanned agricultural vehicles;"Zhenni He a , Yidan Bao a , Qing Yu a , Pingbo Lu b , Yong He a , Yufei Liu a,*";"Automatic headland turning is an important part for an unmanned agricultural vehicle at farming work. Minimize the time and travel distance and maximize the operation efficiency of the vehicles during the turning are the concerns of the current focus. This research tries to present a dynamic headland turning path planning method based on an asymmetric switch-back turning method for four-wheeled vehicles. When an agricultural vehicle slips in the field, the algorithm will re-plan the route dynamically according to the real-time position of the vehicle to improve the operation efficiency and reduce the mechanical wear caused by frequently adjusting the steering wheel. The simulation results showed that when the row width was 2 m and some noises were added in the turning process, the trajectory length planned by the proposed algorithm was reduced by 31.42 % and the lateral deviation was reduced by 95.65 % compared with that planned by the traditional switch-back algorithm. In field experiments, the vehicle approached the next working path with an average lateral deviation of 2.0 cm at a speed of 0.5 m/s during a turn. The average length of the trajectory was 11.84 m, and the average time consumed was 28.4 s. Compared with the traditional switch-back turning, the average trajectory length, average lateral deviation and average cost time were shortened by 10.51 %, 78.75 % and 10.70 %, respectively. The proposed dynamic headland turning path planning method has a significant advantage over the traditional switch-back turning method in terms of both accuracy and time efficiency. The algorithm solves the problems that when the headland width is narrow, the vehicle is difficult to turn and deviates from the predetermined trajectory due to sideslips. Moreover, it ensures the shortest path and time for the agricultural vehicles to turn in the field, which greatly shortens the overall path length and time of its field operations."
350;"Adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices in sub-Saharan Africa: A review of the progress, barriers, gender differences and recommendations";"Oraye Dicta Ogisi a , Toritseju Begho b,";"Climate change is one of the main challenges facing agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where many rely on rain-fed farming for their livelihoods. Climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs) have been identified as a promising solution to combat this problem. This paper reviews the literature on CSAPs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Specifically, the review describes the existing literature on the adoption of CSAPs in the region, provides a more up-to-date summary of this expanding and important issue and presents an overview of the current evidence of CSAPs as a reliable means for farmers in SSA to address the climate change issues. The existing literature suggests that the rate of adoption of CSAPs in SSA is comparatively low. However, the adoption of CSAPs varies greatly across the region. The studies that constitute this review also provide evidence of the benefits of adopting CSAPs to farmers and the environment, ranging from increased productivity, resilience, and income for farmers, decreased greenhouse gas emissions to improved soil health. The decision to adopt particular CSAPs is influenced by several factors, including personal and social-psychological factors, environmental, physical, and ecological factors, farm and economic factors, as well as institutional, policy, and structural factors. Also, gender-based barriers in agriculture impact the adoption of CSAPs in SSA, placing women at a disadvantage. The review concludes that it is crucial to address the barriers and leverage the drivers to improve the adoption rates of CSAPs in SSA."
351;Time-varying dependence structure between oil and agricultural commodity markets: A dependence-switching CoVaR copula approach;"Satish Kumar a,* , Aviral Kumar Tiwari b , Ibrahim Dolapo Raheem c , Erik Hille d";"We examine the energy-food nexus using the dependence-switching copula model. Specifically, we look at the dependence for four distinct market states, such as, increasing oil?increasing commodity, declining oil?declining commodity, increasing oil?declining commodity, as well as declining oil?increasing commodity markets. Our results support the argument that the crash of oil markets and agricultural commodities happen at the same time, especially during crisis period. However, the same is not true during times of normal economic conditions, implying that investors cannot make excess profits in both agricultural and oil markets at once. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the return chasing effect dominates for all commodities on maximum occasions. The CoVaR and ?CoVaR results indicate important risk spillover from oil to agricultural markets, especially around the financial crisis."

Results from a process-based crop model project future increases in wheat, grassland, and soybean yield due to climate change and atmospheric CO2 change corn and sorghum show more muted responses. Results using yields from econometric models show less positive results. Both the econometric and process-based models tend to show more positive yields by the end of the century than several other similar studies. Using the process-based model to provide future yield estimates to an integrated agricultural sector model, the welfare gain is roughly $16B/year (2019 USD) for domestic producers and $6.2B/year for international trade, but domestic consumers lose $10.6B/year, resulting in a total welfare gain of $11.7B/year. When yield projections for major crops are drawn instead from econometric models, total welfare losses of more than $28B/year arise. Simulations using the process-based model as input to the agricultural sector model show large future production increases for soybean, wheat, and sorghum and large price reductions for corn and wheat. The most important factors are those about economic growth, flooding, international trade, and the type of yield model used. Somewhat less, but not insignificant factors include adaptation, livestock productivity, and damages from surface ozone, waterlogging, and pests and diseases."
353;Agricultural space function transitions in rapidly urbanizing areas and their impacts on habitat quality: An urban?Rural gradient study;"Sinan Li a,* , Zhu Congmou b , Yongjun Li a , Baiyu Dong a , Kun Tan c , Xiaodong Deng a";"Agricultural space functions in rapidly urbanizing areas experience rapid transition with urban?rural development process, leading to habitat fragmentation and degradation. Previous studies focused more on impacts of agricultural landscape patterns on habitat quality at the regional scale, ignoring transition processes of agricultural space functions and functional combinations under an urban?rural gradient perspective and their different impacts on habitat quality. This study constructed a holistic framework oriented by four main agricultural space functions, including production, living, ecological, and landscape culture functions, to map transition characteristics of agricultural space function combinations in the main urban area of Hangzhou, a typically rapidly urbanizing area in China, from 2000 to 2019 under the urban?rural gradient. Impacts of these transition processes on habitat quality were further investigated.The results showed that spatiotemporal differences in variations of various agricultural space functions leaded to urban?rural gradient changes in the transition of agricultural space function combinations. From the urban development area to the urban?rural transition area and rural development area, the dominant output type was the single function area, while the dominant input type was the comprehensive function area, composite function area, and single function area, respectively. Areas with decreased habitat quality were mostly concentrated around urban construction land, and they had the highest proportion in the urban development area. All transition types in the urban development area had a negative impact on habitat quality, while the transition process from a more complex function combination to a simpler one in the urban?rural transition area and rural development area had a greater positive impact, and areas transformed from the lagged development area to other functional combinations also produced a positive impact. These findings provide ideas for rational spatial decision-making about limited agricultural resources in rapidly urbanizing areas."
354;Comparing delivery channels to promote nutrition-sensitive agriculture: A cluster-randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh;"Akhter Ahmed a , Fiona Coleman b , John Hoddinott a,b,* , Purnima Menon a , Aklima Parvin a , Audrey Pereira c , Agnes Quisumbing a , Shalini Roy a";"We use a randomized controlled trial in rural Bangladesh to compare two models of delivering nutrition content jointly to husbands and wives: deploying female nutrition workers versus mostly male agriculture extension workers. Both approaches increased nutrition knowledge of men and women, household and individual diet quality, and women?s empowerment. Intervention effects on agriculture and nutrition knowledge, agricultural production diversity, dietary diversity, women?s empowerment, and gender parity do not significantly differ between models where nutrition workers versus agriculture extension workers provide the training. The exception is in an attitudes score, where results indicate same-sex agents may affect scores differently than opposite-sex agents. Our results suggest opposite-sex agents may not necessarily be less effective in providing training. In South Asia, where agricultural extension systems and the pipeline to those systems are maledominated, training men to deliver nutrition messages may offer a temporary solution to the shortage of female extension workers and offer opportunities to scale and promote nutrition-sensitive agriculture. However, in both models, we find evidence that the presence of mothers-in-law within households modifies the programs? effectiveness on some nutrition, empowerment, and attitude measures, suggesting that accounting for other influential household members is a potential area for future programming."

To this end, we constructed a structured methodological approach that future researchers and other stakeholders may use to explore potential gaps for potential avenues for research. The framework starts with a constructed bibliometric dataset comprising 2478 paper abstracts (and associated metadata) published between 2010 and 2019 that contain references to specific ES classes and case study location references worldwide. Next, the dataset was used to construct a Structural Topic Model (STM), which features marginal effect estimation of metadata covariates on topic prevalence and topic prevalence correlation. The estimated topic graph structure is then used for community detection of interconnected topics via cluster identification, which allowed us to determine the current structure of the academic discourse on the interaction between terrestrial ES and agricultural landscape management. We expect this novel approach to enable identification of research priorities, prioritization of project portfolios for our field of interest, and reusable methodological guidelines that can be employed to target other fields of knowledge similarly."

358;Agroecosystem multifunctionality of apple orchards in relation to agricultural management and landscape context;"Robin Daelemans a,b,* , Eva Hulsmans a,b , Lysander Fockaert c , Liesbet Vranken c , Luc De Bruyn d,e , Olivier Honnay a,b";"Managing agricultural landscapes to simultaneously provide multiple ecosystem services is crucial to meet both environmental and societal demands. This not only requires surveying and modeling many ecosystem services at the same time, but also quantifying the impact of agricultural management and the surrounding landscape on agroecosystem multifunctionality. In this study, we assessed the agroecosystem multifunctionality of 12 organic apple orchards and 12 orchards with integrated pest management (IPM) using field data on 23 indicators for agronomical, ecological and economic performance. Furthermore, the ecological performance indicators were also quantified in 12 semi-natural grasslands to obtain a benchmark for the overall impact of agricultural management on biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystem services. We found that organic farming at the field scale had relatively limited beneficial effects on ecological performance, yet it provided farmers with a similar income relative to IPM, despite lower yield levels. Overall orchard multifunctionality did not differ between organic and IPM orchards, regardless of hypothetical stakeholder interests, and a clear trade-off between biodiversity and yield was found within both orchard systems. Structural equation models revealed that in addition to orchard management, also within-orchard location, local biodiversity and characteristics of the surrounding landscape were directly and/or indirectly driving ecosystem service indicator levels. Surrounding semi-natural habitat and landscape complexity enhanced biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystem services, and the higher provisioning of several services in the semi-natural benchmark further emphasizes the importance of preserving semi-natural habitats within the agricultural landscape. Overall, our results indicate that reconciling ecological, agronomical and economic goals requires a vision that goes beyond the field-level agricultural management. Therefore, we argue that policy measures should not only address local farm management, but should also target actions towards other stakeholders such as land managers and agricultural markets."
359;Socio-economic and energy-environmental impacts of technological change on Chinas agricultural development under the carbon neutrality strategy;"Hong-Dian Jiang a, b , Rui Yu a , Xiang-Yan Qian b, c,";"Promoting agricultural modernisation through technological change is an important strategy for China. Chinas carbon neutrality strategy is leading to systemic socio-economic changes that could exacerbate the uncertainty of agricultural development. Therefore, applying a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this study characterises the agricultural sector in detail, introducing endogenous technological change proxied by research and development (R&D) to assess the impact of different technological change scenarios on agricultural development under the carbon neutrality target. The results show that allocating carbon revenue for R&D inputs can mitigate the significant negative impact of achieving carbon neutrality on knowledge capital and production in agricultural sectors. Overall, using carbon revenue only for R&D input in crop sectors has the optimal effect on increasing the agricultural sectors knowledge capital, improving crop production and profit, reducing crop external dependence and promoting the synergistic reduction of carbon and pollutant emissions. However, this scenario has the largest negative impact on macro-economics and household welfare. In contrast, allocating carbon revenue to promote technological change in broader non-energy sectors or both crops and non-energy sectors can effectively mitigate negative socio-economic impacts, but the positive impact on agricultural development is minimal. These findings provide practical insights for the rational use of carbon revenue to expand agricultural R&D investment and ensure balanced agricultural and economic development under the carbon neutrality target."

The related GHG emission (including N2O and CH4) and changes in soil carbon stock are defined here as ?agricultural carbon outcomes?. Accurate quantification of agricultural carbon outcomes is the basis for achieving emission reductions for agriculture, but existing approaches for measuring carbon outcomes (including direct measurements, emission factors, and process-based modeling) fall short of achieving the required accuracy and scalability necessary to support credible, verifiable, and cost-effective measurement and improvement of these carbon outcomes. Here we propose a foundational and scalable framework to quantify field-level carbon outcomes for farmland, which is based on the holistic carbon balance of the agroecosystem: Agroecosystem Carbon Outcomes ? Environment (E) ? Management (M) ? Crop (C). Following a comprehensive review of the scientific challenges associated with existing approaches, as well as their tradeoffs between cost andaccuracy, we propose that the most viable path for the quantification of field-level carbon outcomes in agricultural land is through an effective integration of various approaches (e.g. diverse observations, sensor/in-situ data, and modeling), defined as the ?System-of-Systems? solution. Such a ?System-of-Systems? solution should simultaneously comprise the following components: (1) scalable collection of ground truth data and cross-scale sensing of environment variables (E), management practices (M), and crop conditions (C) at the local field level (2) advanced modeling with necessary processes to support the quantification of carbon outcomes (3) systematic Model-Data Fusion (MDF), i.e. robust and efficient methods to integrate sensing data and models at each local farmland level (4) high computation efficiency and artificial intelligence (AI) to scale to millions of individual fields with low cost and (5) robust and multi-tier validation systems and infrastructures to ensure solution fidelity and true scalability, i.e. the ability of a solution to perform robustly with accepted accuracy on all targeted fields. In this regard, we provide here the detailed scientific rationale, current progress, and future research and development (R&D) priorities to achieve different components of the ?System-of-Systems? solution, thus accomplishing the Environment?Management?Crop framework to quantify field-level agricultural carbon outcomes.

361;Scenario-based urban growth simulation by incorporating ecological-agricultural-urban suitability into a Future Land Use Simulation model;"Long Li a,b,c , Xianjin Huang a,c,* , Hong Yang d,";"China?s rapid urbanization has imposed a considerable strain on land resources and infrastructure, resulting in environmental deterioration, food shortage, traffic congestion, and various other challenges. The urban growth boundary (UGB) is regarded as an important policy instrument for managing and curbing urban sprawl. Previous studies on UGB have focused on the quantity and spatial constraints of built-up land concerning natural resources conservation. However, achieving a balance between urban conservation and development by easing the conflict between land functions is not yet well understood. To bridge this gap, combining ?bottom-up? local spatial simulation with ?top-down? regulation and human constraint, this study simulated multi-scenario urban expansion and UGB in Jiangsu Province, China in 2035 using ecological-agricultural-urban suitability assessment and a Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model. The results show that the maintenance of different land functions will have a significant impact on the number, spatial distribution, and landscape characteristics of UGB. Under the integrated development scenario, UGB will have the largest area (27,893.33 km2 ) with the most significant agglomeration characteristics. The delineated UGB, coupling ecological-agricultural-urban suitability, will reflect regional heterogeneous resource endowment and can further alleviate conflicts between multiple objectives. For fairness and equality between cities, future urban expansion should emphasize the development of less-developed areas. This study expands a new insight for simulating urban expansion and offers practical recommendations for orderly urban growth and sustainable urban management in other cities"
362;Investigating the effects of drought and lockdowns on smallholder and commercial agricultural production in KwaZulu-Natal using remotely sensed data;"N.C. Fouotsa Manfouo *, D. Von Fintel";"Not many efforts have been made so far to understand the effects of both the 2015?2016 drought and the 2020 lockdown measures on the agricultural production of smallholder vis-a-vis commercial farmers in KwazuluNatal. Google Earth Engine, and random forest algorithm, are used to generate a dataset that help to investigate this question. A regression is performed on double differenced data to investigate the effects of interest. A kmean cluster analysis, is also used to determine whether the distribution patterns of crop production changed with drought and disruption of agricultural production input. Results show that: (1) droughts affected the agricultural production of both areas similarly. Crop cover declined in both areas for one season after droughts were broken. Then recovery was driven by greener, more productive crops rather than the expansion of crop area. (2) The response of both areas to the COVID-19 lockdown was also similar. Both smallholder and commercial areas? Normalised Difference Vegetation Index ? a proxy for crop vitality ? improved in response to regulations favourable to the sector and improved rainfall. No significant adjustments in crop cover were observed. Production therefore changed primarily at the intensive margin (improved productivity of existing croplands) rather than the extensive (changing the extent of land under cultivation). (3) Cluster analysis allows for a more granular view, showing that the positive impact of lockdowns on agriculture were concentrated in areas with high rainfall and close proximity to metropolitan markets. Both smallholder and commercial farmers therefore are reliant on market access together with favourable environmental conditions for improved production."
363;An integrated distributed robust optimization framework for agricultural water-food-energy management integrating ecological impact and dynamic water cycle processes;"Shanshan Guo a , Yuting Yang a,* , Ping Guo b,c";"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) appeal to decision-makers to consider the impact of agriculture on different aspects, including the economic, social, ecological and environmental influences. This study establishes an integrated distributed water-food-energy management model that simultaneously considers resource-saving, economic development, ecological restoration, social security guarantee and environmental improvement to realize sustainability according to optimal resource allocation. The developed model considers the full dynamic of the water cycle, including water exchanges between river, canal, soil and aquifer. The irrigation units are regarded as decision units and hydrological response units, which are determined based on the canal distribution. A net-primary-productivity-based method is proposed for ecological and environmental benefits of agricultural production. Additionally, a comprehensive multi-objective robust programming is proposed to deal with uncertainties in both objectives and constraints, with optimality and feasibility robustness guaranteed. Taking an arid area in northwestern China as a working example, the modeling outputs offer strategies for water and energy uses under 27 risk scenarios. The feasibility robustness analysis uncovers the degree and source of risks faced by different vegetation and decision units. The optimality robustness analysis shows the influence of different uncertainties on the objectives and helps recognize sensitive objectives. These outputs can satisfy decision-makers with different risk preferences, reveal the independent and mutual effects of different uncertainties, and help recognize the key indicators of sustainable development."
364;Assessment of agricultural adaptations to climate change from a water-energy-food nexus perspective;"Lina Wu a,* , Amin Elshorbagy a,b,c , Warren Helgason a,b";"Adapting agriculture to climate change without deteriorating natural resources (e.g., water and energy) is critical to sustainable development. In this paper, we first comprehensively evaluate six agricultural adaptations in response to climate change (2021?2050) through the lens of the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus in Saskatchewan, Canada, using a previously developed nexus model?WEF-Sask. The adaptations involve agronomic measures (early planting date, reducing soil evaporation, irrigation expansion), genetic improvement (cultivars with larger growing degree days (GDD) requirement), and combinations of individual adaptations. The results show that the selected adaptations compensate for crop yield losses (wheat, canola, pea), caused by climate change, to various extents. However, from a nexus perspective, there are mixed effects on water productivity (WP), total agricultural water (green and blue) use, energy consumption for irrigation, and hydropower generation. Individual adaptations such as early planting date and increased GDD requirement compensate for yield losses in both rainfed (0?60 %) and irrigated (18?100 %) conditions with extra use of green water (5?7 %), blue water (2?14 %), and energy for irrigation (2?14 %). Reducing soil water evaporation benefits the overall WEF nexus by compensating for rainfed yield losses (25?82 %) with less use of blue water and energy consumption for irrigation. The combination of the above three adaptations has the potential to sustain agricultural production in water-scarce regions. If irrigation expansion is also included, the combined adaptation almost fully offsets agricultural production losses from climate change but significantly increases blue water use (143?174 %) and energy consumption for irrigation while reducing hydropower production (3 %). This study provides an approach to comprehensively evaluating agricultural adaptation strategies, in response to climate change, and insights to inform decision-makers."
365;Contribution of natural and agricultural activities on Fe dynamics: Insights from Fe isotope in soils under different land-use types;"Qian Zhang a , Guilin Han b,*";"Evaluating the contribution of natural and agricultural factors on Fe dynamics in soils is crucial to the study of material cycling in critical zone observation. Five soil profiles under cultivated land, abandoned cultivated land, grassland, shrub land, and secondary forest from Puding karst catchment in Guizhou Province, China, were analyzed to identify natural and agricultural contributions to Fe processes. Vertical distribution changes of Fe content and Fe isotopic compositions (d56Fe) were investigated. The results presented that natural chemical weathering accompanied by soil erosion occurs primarily in the upper layer, leading to the loss of Fe from the surface to the bottom during the eluviation-illuviation process. Fe isotopic fractionation occurred in soils rich in natural organic matter (i.e., secondary forest and shrub land), resulting in the accumulation of lighter Fe isotopes. Soil impacted by anthropogenic activity have higher Fe content (e.g., cultivated land or abandoned cultivated land). The reduction of Fe is the principal cause of light Fe isotopes in the upper layer, which is caused by periodic artificial irrigation on cultivated land. Compared to worldwide soils, Puding soils are impacted by natural organic matter, eluviation-illuviation, and agricultural activities, which tend to modify Fe isotopic signatures on a local scale within soil profiles. Fe isotopic fractionations in bulk soils among different land-use soils are very limited. This study provides insightful analysis based on Fe isotopic to recognize natural and anthropogenic activities on Fe dynamic, and offers information on material cycling in the Puding karst catchment."

The case of Uganda;"Robert Brenya * , Jing Zhu";"While a robust correlation has been proven between agricultural extension advisory service (AEAS) and increases in agricultural production in literature, it?s undefined whether this holds true between AEAS and food security. This study stretched the theory from increased agricultural production to food security by using WB-LSMS data from 2009 to 2020. We set up a treated and a control group and then employed difference-in-difference and kernel PSM-DID to analyze the two groups, whiles applying stationarity, cointegration, and post-estimation diagnostic tests to ensure data robustness. The results denote a positive relationship between AEAS and food security while factors including capital, finance, and region, among others hinder households from engaging in AEAS. Policy implications are outlined for AEAS and food security integration."

This cannot be achieved without combining all forms of sciences including mathematics and statistics with agriculture practice to make agriculture sustainable. Agriculture has been considered the backbone of the economic systems of developing and developed countries. However, while practicing the activities, various conflicting issues incorporate and make the situation challenging for the agriculture industry in the decision-making process. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques can provide the optimal solution and they have proved to be viable in various complex decision-making problems of the real world like agriculture-related decision-making problems. They can help to find a suitable alternative for a particular complex situation. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) a globally accepted method has been a winning arc of the MCDM techniques.

370;Public agriculture investment and food security in ECOWAS;"Madalitso A. Kamenya a , Sheryl L. Hendriks a,* , Colleta Gandidzanwa a , John Ulimwengu b , Sunday Odjo c";"Public agriculture expenditure is a significant growth catalyst. However, evaluating the impact of public agriculture expenditure on food security remains scanty. This paper assessed the impact of public expenditure on food security in nine ECOWAS countries using four indicators of food security, one in each dimension (availability, access, utilization and stability). Using a fixed-effect generalized least squares model the study found that public agricultural expenditure has improved. However, this has not translated to an automatic improvement in food security. The levels of stunting and undernourishment were still high in the nine ECOWAS countries. A oneunit increase in public agriculture expenditure was associated with a 0.2% reduction in undernourishment and an improved average dietary energy supply adequacy between 2000 and 2016. The paper concluded that the nine ECOWAS countries have made considerable progress in improving food availability, that public agriculture expenditure by share has increased in the nine ECOWAS countries since the inception of CAADP, with several countries meeting the 10% target of spending on agriculture for several years and that public agricultural expenditure had a positive impact on food accessibility and availability. The analysis could be replicated in the design of national food security investment plans and help identify strategies to accelerate food security and nutrition improvements in African countries."
371;A machine learning approach to assess implications of Climate Risk Factors on Agriculture: The Indian case;"Paritosh Jha 1,* , Sona Chinngaihlian 1 , Priyanka Upreti 1 , Akanksha Handa 1";"The paper examines the direct and indirect implications of the risk factors relating to climate change on various parameters of agricultural production/productivity in India. India, being an emerging economy with considerable dependence on agriculture both for food security and employment generation, offers an important case study for understanding the macro-economic issues and designing the right set of policy approach for mitigating implications of climate change. Furthermore, unlike other central banks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shares a close association with agriculture owing to the continued credit support to the sector as part of its priority sector lending policy, and because it is closely involved in addressing climate change. The paper focuses on the decade of 2010s, the recorded warmest decade till now and adopts a machine learning approach (sequential multivariate adaptive regression splines model) to assess the interaction between climate risk factors and agriculture. To the best of our knowledge, the modelling approach applied in this paper is unique, novel and of the first kind to assess the implications of climate change on agriculture. The results indicate that carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, precipitation, irrigation water used, and rainfall are the most prominent factors affecting different parameters of agricultural production. These factors are taken at the yearly aggregate level and their interactions among themselves, particularly CO2 emissions, affect productivity of foodgrains and oilseeds, providing a detailed insight about the recent decade of climate change in the context of Indian economy."

Using an agricultural diversity index constituting crop livestock and fruit diversity, level of agricultural diversity was 28.22%). Bivariate correlation analysis showed that agricultural diversity had a significant positive relationship with household income (r = 0.369), wealth (r = 0.363), and dietary diversity (r = 0.144 for children, r = 0.298 for women, and r = 0.211 for men). However, agricultural diversity had no significant effect on nutritional status of children, women, and men. This implies that to influence nutrition, other factors, such as better health, need to complement agricultural diversity."

In this paper, Taking Yan?an City of loess hilly and gully region (LHGR) as the study area, 30m resolution Landsat TM/OLI data in the year of 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2018 were selected, and kernel density estimation and geographic detector model were used to analyzes the process of GAPT, and to explore the driving force of GAPT in the LP and its spatial-temporal differentiation pattern. The results show that: (1) In the past 20 years, the gully agricultural production in the Yan?an LHGR has shown a divergent distribution and phased expansion, and the overall trend of fluctuating shrinkage. The gully agricultural production transformation center of gravity in the study area has shifted from the middle-altitude to the low-altitude area. (2) The gully agricultural production in the study area is transforming to agglomeration at small spatial scales. GAPT mostly occurs in the water supply belts near river waters, and in the area close to roads and areas near rural settlements which are closely related to human activities. (3) The process of GAPT mainly driven by socio-economic factors and policy factors, and it presents three evolution characteristics: contiguous distribution of traditional agricultural production, transformation of modern gully agricultural production functions, and modern agricultural and tourism multifunctional three-industry integration. The essence is the functional transformation of gully agricultural land. (4) GAPT in the LP is driven by many factors. Behavior subjects at different levels would promote the GAPT in different directions under the background of major national and regional development policies. The research results can provide scientific reference for crop planting mode adjustment, sustainable land use management, and the similar regional agriculture green transformation, thus supporting the realization of the strategic objectives of high-quality agricultural development and rural revitalization in the Yellow River Basin."

Cropland management practices have large impacts on agricultural soils, but have rarely been considered in previous SOC mapping work. In this study, cropland management practices including carbon input (CI), length of cultivation (LC), and irrigation (Irri) were incorporated as agricultural management covariates and integrated with natural variables to predict the spatial distribution of SOC using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of incorporating agricultural management practice variables in the prediction of cropland topsoil SOC. A case study was carried out in a traditional agricultural area in the Tuojiang River Basin, China. We found that CI was the most important environmental covariate for predicting cropland SOC. Adding cropland management practices to natural variables improved prediction accuracy, with the coefficient of determination (R2 ), the root mean squared error (RMSE) and Lin?s Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) improving by 16.67%, 17.75% and 5.62%, respectively. Our results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating agricultural management practice information into SOC prediction models. We conclude that the construction of spatio-temporal database of agricultural management practices derived from inventories is a research priority to improve the reliability of SOC model prediction."

Thanks to the satellite images obtained from remote sensing sensors, information can be obtained on many subjects such as the detection and development of agricultural products and annual product forecasting. In this study, it is aimed to automatically detect agricultural crops (corn and cotton) by using Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 satellite image indexes via a new deep learning approach (Deep Transformer Encoder). This work was carried out in several stages, respectively. In the first stage, a pilot area was determined to obtain Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 satellite images of agricultural crops used in this study. In the second stage, the coordinates of 100 sample points from this pilot area were taken with the help of GPS and these coordinates were then transferred to Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 satellite images. In the next step, reflection and backscattering values were obtained from the pixels of the satellite images corresponding to the sample points of these agricultural crops. While creating the data sets of satellite images, the months of June, July, August and September for the years 2016?2021, when the development and harvesting times of agricultural products are close to each other, were preferred. The image data set used in the study consists of a total of 434 images for Sentinel-1 satellite and a total of 693 images for Landsat-8. At the last stage, the datasets obtained from different satellite images were evaluated in three different categories for crop identification with the aid of Deep Transformer Encoder approach. These are: (1-) Crop identification with only Sentinel-1 dataset, (2-) Crop identification only with Landsat-8 dataset, (3-) Crop identification with both Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 datasets. The results showed that 85%, 95% and 87.5% accuracy values were obtained from the band parameters of Sentinel-1 dataset, Landsat-8 dataset and Sentinel1&Landsat-8 datasets, respectively."
376;Modelling farmers? adoption decisions of sustainable agricultural practices under varying agro-ecological conditions: A new perspective;"Wisdom Richard Mgomezulu a,b,c,* , Kennedy Machira a , Abdi-Khalil Edriss a , Innocent Pangapanga-Phiri d";"Different scholars have modelled the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) with a goal of improving farmers adaptive capacity to climate change. Nonetheless, through the conventional way of defining adoption decisions as one-time survey decisions, many scholars have failed to understand inconsistencies in adoption decisions and dis-adoption of such practices. Through a survey of 2100 maize farming households, the current study employed multivariate probit models to understand and compare one-time survey season adoption decisions and sustained (consistent) adoption decisions. The study notes that dis-adoption rates of SAPs range from 20 to 27 percent. As such, the determinants of dis-adoption were estimated to build a case for going beyond one-time adoption survey decisions. Furthermore, the study employed a Cox Proportional hazard model to understand the relative risk to adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices over time. The findings reveal the need for a modelling paradigm shift in understanding adoption decisions for sustainable benefits. Past research has focused on understanding whether farmers adopted SAPs in a previous survey season period. Nonetheless, efforts to ensure sustainable productivity and food security remains lacking amidst climate change. The current study reveals evidence of a need for a modelling shift towards sustained adoption of SAPs for sustainable development of agriculture. Lastly, the findings reveal the need for intensifying knowledge and information dissemination on SAPs through field demonstrations, extension visits, trainings and radio programs in order to reduce dis-adoption and ensure sustained adoption."

D-optimal experimental designs were applied to optimize filter plate extraction (FPE) for one-single extraction of multipolar hazardous substances. The vDIA mode was used to collect all precursor ion fragments within the range to supplement data loss caused by DDA mode. The underlying principle of vDIA is to increase the utilization rate of MS2 spectra that are likely to identify a maximum number and minimum amounts of hazardous substances. Compared with traditional DDA mode alone, a combination of the two modes increased the rate of identification of hazardous substances by 18.5%. The molecular network of hazardous substance provided by GNPS could enable some metabolites and structure-related products to discover potentially hazardous substance."
378;"Critical support for different stages of innovation in agriculture: What, when, how?";"Egil Petter Str?e a,* , Jostein Vik a,b , Eirik Magnus Fuglestad a , Mads Dahl Gjefsen a , Anders M. Mel? a , Roger A. S?aa a,c";"CONTEXT: The agricultural sector is undergoing several transitions through ?smart-farming? technologies. To make this innovation responsible, it is critical to support technological innovation at different stages of innovation with customized strategies for the individual technology. OBJECTIVE: What are the critical support functions at different stages of technological innovation in agriculture? METHODS: Four technologies are analysed: Automated Milking Systems (AMS), a digital fencing system for the virtual herding of goats, a technology for drone-based observation and management in agriculture and forestry, and round baler silage systems. These are analysed as sociotechnical constructions of multiple stakeholders, with heterogeneous pathways to societal acceptance and practical usage on the farm. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: To provide information about how such technology can be created in a responsible manner, the paper suggests a Balanced Readiness Level assessment (BRLa) to highlight five dimensions for technological maturity: technological, market, regulatory, social acceptance, and organizational maturity. Through this approach, the findings show that each phase of the technological development benefits from specifically targeted support and that support functions should not be underestimated in order to get technology to a higher level of acceptance."
379;Modernization in agricultural water distribution system for aquifer storage and recovery ? A case study;"Mohsen Hosseini Jolfan a , S. Mehdy Hashemy Shahdany a,* , Saman Javadi a , Sami Ghordoyee Milan a , Aminreza Neshat b , Ronny Berndtsson c,* , Hamed Tork a";"High water consumption in the agricultural sector, population growth, urbanization, and industrialization have gradually turned groundwater into a quantitative and qualitative crisis. This study investigated aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) as the environmental effect of modernization projects in agricultural water distribution systems. For this purpose, a numerical model of the Qazvin Aquifer located in central Iran was developed using MODFLOW for spatial analysis of ASR before/after modernization. Besides, to investigate the operational performance of the water distribution systems in the status quo, a hydraulic flow simulation model of the surface water distribution systems, including the main open canal and lateral, was developed in MATLAB, calibrated, and verified by the observed operational data. Then, this hydraulic model was coupled with the developed automatic control systems, including the de-centralized & centralized real-time controllers, as the modernization alternatives. The hydraulic-operation simulation results reveal that the agricultural water distribution system?s performance improved the reliability of the surface water delivery process by nearly 33% for the de-centralized control system and by approximately 35% for the centralized control system. Consequently, numerical modeling results indicate that the groundwater table will keep declining at an annual rate of about 1.5 m using the conventional operating system in the status quo. Also, the results show that groundwater extraction decreased by 45% and 60% in the de-centralized and centralized automated methods, respectively. Therefore, the proposed ASR approach in the present study, based on the operational automation of the surface flow within the irrigation district, can be introduced as a practical and reliable approach to upgrading the conjunctive surface-groundwater agricultural water distribution system in irrigation districts worldwide."
380;Optimal reservoir operation and risk analysis of agriculture water supply considering encounter uncertainty of precipitation in irrigation area and runoff from upstream;"Shuo Zhang a , Yan Kang a,b,* , Xuan Gao a , Peiru Chen a , Xiao Cheng a , Songbai Song a,b , Lingjie Li c";"The precipitation in irrigation area and the runoff from upstream can reflect the natural and irrigated agriculture water supply situations. The wetness?dryness encounter uncertainty of precipitation and runoff, affected by the different microclimate in the basin, can lead to the potential water supply risk of reservoir dispatching, which poses a threat to food security. This study develops an innovative integrated modeling framework by coupling Copula joint distribution of precipitation and runoff, the reservoir multi?objective optimal operation model, and multi?criteria decision?making CECG?VIKOR method to assess agriculture water supply risk in the Baojixia Irrigation Area (BIA) of Northwest China. The results indicated that the integrated methodology is an important tool for assessing agriculture water supply risk, which has comprehensive, advanced, and efficient features. The correlation between the precipitation in BIA and runoff from upstream is weak, which can lead to a high uncertainty of the natural and irrigated agriculture water supply conditions. The Clayton copula was more suitable for estimating the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff. And there was a large probability of an unfavorable water balance situation in the BIA, with the extreme water shortage encounter condition of precipitation and runoff had the maximum joint distribution probability of 23.50%. The 9 scheduling schemes were set up according to encounter scenarios and whose optimal scheduling results are R104, R116, R66, R95, R5, R28, R117, R89, and R110, respectively. Among the 9 optimal scheduling results, the water supply risk in BIA increased with the decrease of available water supply and the increase of water demand. Below middle and middle water supply risk were mainly faced by scheme A and B with an occurrence probability of 62.47%, while scheme C had a high risk with an occurrence probability of 37.53% in BIA. The research results can provide a scientific basis for reservoir dispatching risk research and new ideas for making dispatching plans."
381;Time-dependent performance evaluation of tire repair emergency systems in the agricultural stage of sugarcane mills;"Carolina Reis Gualberto a , Lasara ? Fabr?ia Rodrigues b,* , Reinaldo Morabito c , Joao ? Flavio ? de Freitas Almeida b";"This study presents a stationary backlog-carryover (SBC) approach to deal with hypercube queuing models with time-dependent user arrival rates for the analysis of emergency agricultural systems. It is motivated by practical situations faced by the agricultural stage of sugarcane mills. Due to the frequent changes in the locations of harvest fronts, the emergency calls for tire repair also change their locations over time, and managers should determine the appropriate number and locations of servers and their dispatch policies. This approach is applied to a case study conducted in the tire repair emergency services of a sugarcane mill. A simulation model is also developed to crosscheck the validity of this approach. This work aims at analyzing and highlighting the importance of considering time-dependent changes in arrival rates at different regions of the system. The findings suggest that this approach is flexible enough to deal with alternative dispatch policies, changes in the number of servers, and the increase in server utilization rates."
382;Quantile risk spillovers between energy and agricultural commodity markets: Evidence from pre and during COVID-19 outbreak;"Aviral Kumar Tiwari a,b , Emmanuel Joel Aikins Abakah c , Adeolu O. Adewuyi d , Chien-Chiang Lee e,";"The spillover effect is a significant factor impacting the volatility of commodity prices. Unlike earlier studies, this research uses the rolling window-based Quantile VAR (QVAR) model to describe the conditional volatility spillover between energy, biofuel and agricultural commodity markets. Since the magnitude of connectedness and spillover effects may switch between bearish and bullish market states over time, a QVAR model is a relatively realistic and appropriate approach to capture the connectedness as compared to the mean-based approaches of Diebold and Yilmaz (DY 2009, 2012, & 2014) which are mostly used in the literature. To this end, we employ volatility estimates by using the realized variance advanced by Parkinson (1980). Specifically, we investigate the time-varying volatility spillovers and connectedness among agricultural markets (wheat, corn, sugar, soyabean, coffee, and cotton), energy markets (gasoline, crude oil, natural gas) and biofuel (ethanol) markets from January 12, 2012 to May 10, 2021. By comparing our empirical analysis with results from the DY spillover model, we establish that connectedness is stronger in the left and right quantiles than those in the mean and median of the conditional distribution, emphasizing the importance of systematic risk spillovers during extreme market movements. Furthermore, results find that volatility spillovers and connectedness in the right tail is higher than in the left tail. In particular, we document significant volatility spillovers from agricultural markets to energy markets during extreme markets conditions and observe the dominance of agricultural markets over energy markets. To ascertain the impact of COVID-19 on the volatility of markets examined, we divide our sample into sub-samples and observe significant variation in the level of volatility spillovers and connectedness across the markets before and during the outbreak of COVID-19. Finally, some useful implications are summarized for investors? portfolios and risk avoidance."
383;A new look at agricultural development and the non-agriculture economy in low-income countries;Thomas George;"This paper documents the remarkably consistent historical pairing of agriculture (Ag) and non-agriculture (NonAg) economic growth and its implications for agricultural development. Corroborating a prior study, new country-level data reveal that farmers in low-income countries strive to close the yield gap when high returns are expected. A return adds value per Ag worker or Ag GDP per capita aka labor productivity. Time series data reveal high correlations for Ag GDP per capita and cereal yields with NonAg GDP per capita for countries, regions and the world, and for country groups based on income, debt, or level of development. In effect, both cereal yields and Ag GDP progress in tandem with that of GDP. Economic history/institutional economics inform that robust GDP growth ensues under conditions of 1) efficient technologies, 2) improved skills and 3) efficient markets. Markets are efficient only to the extent that formal contracts and informal agreements are honored by market participants broadly. There is strong evidence that poor contract compliance is the foremost market inefficiency preventing robust GDP growth. To achieve agronomy resurgence, robust Ag GDP growth, and a higher probability of returns for all market participants, markets must have a high degree of contract compliance."
384;An enhanced version of the D-Risk decision support webtool for multi-scale management of water abstraction and drought risks in irrigated agriculture;"Rishma Chengot a,b , Jerry W. Knox a , Gemma Coxon c , George Cojocaru d , Ian P. Holman a,";"Due to it having the lowest priority for water allocation during drought events and the consequent agronomic and economic impacts of abstraction restrictions, UK irrigated agriculture has been identified as a key business sector ?at risk?. An enhanced version of the D-Risk webtool has been developed to help agricultural stakeholders and catchment water managers to evaluate the joint multi-scale risks of abstraction restrictions (voluntary and mandatory) and having insufficient irrigation volumes during drought events. The webtool uses annual maximum potential soil moisture deficit as the agroclimate index to calculate monthly and annual volumetric irrigation demand for the selected crop mix, soil available water capacity and location. Simulated river flows are used to identify days not under abstraction restrictions. Annual probability distributions of irrigation deficit and licence utilisation (headroom) are derived from a monthly time-step water balance model that calculates whether the farm irrigation demand in each month can be met, taking account of river flow-based abstraction restrictions, daily and annual volumetric licensed abstraction limits, the licenced abstraction period(s) and any on-farm reservoir storage. The enhanced D-Risk tool provides a more holistic understanding of drought risk on irrigated agriculture from individual farm to catchment scales and supports improved collaborative decision-making regarding future water sharing, water trading and on-farm reservoir investment to reduce business vulnerability to drought and regulatory change."
385;"Water scarcity in agriculture: An overview of causes, impacts and approaches for reducing the risks";"Carlo Ingrao a,* , Rossana Strippoli a , Giovanni Lagioia a , Donald Huisingh b";"Freshwater is a vital resource for both ecosystem health and human survival, and it is the natural resource that is the most extracted at the global level. Excessive freshwater consumption can be responsible for a scarcity in the circulation rate, which occurs when the freshwater demand exceeds its availability. Hence, water consumption needs to be optimised in all human activities, given the increasing freshwater scarcity due to climate changes and to the annual net increase in the human population of 81,000,000. Freshwater plays many important roles in daily life for example, agriculture is responsible for nearly 70% of that withdrawal volume, and it is therefore, the most water-intensive sector. This puts emphasis upon the urgent need of transitioning towards more sustainable agricultural and food-production/consumption systems. Water Footprint (WF) is increasingly playing a guiding role in that context. Indeed, it makes it possible to quantify water consumption and related environmental consequences. With the objective of contributing to enhancement of research and of supporting practitioners and decision-makers in environmentally sustainable and resilient food production/consumption, the authors of this article addressed the relevant issues connected with: a) physical and economic water scarcity in agriculture, b) practices and tools to reduce water wastage, c) WF assessment methodologies. A number of environmental, economic, and engineering solutions were proposed to mitigate water scarcity. The improvement of irrigation technologies and practices was identified as an important major way to reduce water scarcity. Additionally, solar powered ?reverse-osmosis? is being used in many parts of the world to produce irrigation water from saline water, thereby reducing the need to extract freshwater from underground aquifers. This article confirmed the importance of research on water scarcity moreover, it can stimulate development and application of solutions that make agricultural production/consumption more efficient and resilient."
386;Quantifying the impacts of agricultural alteration and climate change on the water cycle dynamics in a headwater catchment of Lake Urmia Basin;"Javad Rahmani , Mohammad Danesh-Yazdi";"The rapid shrinkage of Lake Urmia over the past two decades has raised serious environmental concerns. Several restoration plans have been proposed to reduce agricultural water consumption to supply a remarkable fraction of the lake?s environmental flow requirement. However, an accurate and realistic evaluation of the effectiveness of these plans in reducing agricultural water consumption across the basin is still poorly understood. This study assessed the water-saving potential of agricultural alteration in a snow-dominated catchment in the Lake Urmia Basin. In particular, we explored the impact of crop pattern alteration via reducing the cultivation area and employing different irrigation systems. We further studied the degree of extra stress on the agricultural water demand under the future trends of air temperature and precipitation due to climate change. To this end, we developed a three-dimensional physically-based hydrological model that simulated the main processes involved in the water and energy cycles. In this setting, a surface-groundwater model was coupled to a land-surface model that integratively computed the spatiotemporal variability of evapotranspiration, snowmelt, groundwater, and soil moisture in the root zone, among other processes. Pumping from wells and different irrigation systems were also included in the model. The results showed that a reduction in the cultivation area does not necessarily lead to a significant saving in the total water loss due to evapotranspiration, which strongly depends on the trade-off between the decrease in transpiration and the increase in soil evaporation. We further found that saving in agricultural water consumption is partly controlled by topography and the vertical distribution of soil moisture. Also, the drip irrigation system showed lower evapotranspiration rates than the spray irrigation system. Finally, the study of the future impacts of climate change revealed that the agriculture sector would be under more intensive stress, which poses a severe threat to the long-term restoration of Lake Urmia if effective agricultural management practices are not taken into consideration. The findings of this study highlight important issues for the Lake Urmia restoration plans on agricultural water management. Given the fragility of the lake ecosystem, this study suggests a reliable modeling framework for water and agricultural managers to identify the most appropriate regions in the basin that would yield the highest saving in agricultural water consumption by improving the current crop patterns and irrigation systems."
387;"Applications of extended reality (XR) in agriculture, livestock farming, and aquaculture: A review";"Evangelos Anastasiou a,* , Athanasios T. Balafoutis b , Spyros Fountas a";"The primary sector is facing a series of challenges such as climate change, overpopulation, freshwater scarcity, energy poverty, urbanization and an ageing population. On top of that, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the sector even more. Extended Reality (XR) is a promising technology that can enable the solving of the aforementioned challenges. The main aim of this study was to analyze the use of XR in agriculture, livestock farming, and aquaculture, as well as to identify trends and gaps in its use. Therefore, a literature review was conducted to classify relevant research studies according to XR use in terms of focus area and application type, and human ? machine interaction in relation to XR type, XR viewer device, and XR controller type. The results indicated that there is huge potential from the application of XR in the primary sector, even if this field of studies is at a premature level. Moreover, there are many ways and devices that allow human-machine interaction in XR environments for agriculture, livestock farming, and aquaculture. Further research is needed to solve health and privacy and security issues and achieve seamless and more immersive interaction in XR environments, thereby enabling users to take full benefit of XR technology in the primary sector."
388;The impact of entrepreneurship of farmers on agriculture and rural economic growth: Innovation-driven perspective;"Yuxi Pan * , Siqian Zhang, Mengyue Zhang";"This research delves into the underlying impacts of farmers innovative entrepreneurship on agricultural and rural economic development in China, adopting a dynamic and spatio-temporal perspective. The study utilizes panel data encompassing 30 provinces (cities and autonomous regions) from 2015 to 2020, with a systematic consideration of diversified spatial weight matrices. The empirical findings reveal that the spatial distribution of rural innovative entrepreneurship demonstrates a characteristic of low-low agglomeration, accompanied by evident positive spatial spillover effects and radiation-driving effects, especially in regions with similar urbanization levels. Additionally, the study identifies heterogeneous effects across regions with different grain production patterns and household income levels. Ultimately, the research underscores the significance of deeply integrating farmers innovation and entrepreneurship and provides empirical evidence to support the necessity of adopting differentiated and specialized incentive measures for rural entrepreneurship amid the context of the new economic normal."
389;"Biochar from agricultural crop residues: Environmental, production, and life cycle assessment overview";"Maga Ram Patel , Narayan Lal Panwar";"In circular economies, it is imperative to implement effective environmental management solutions to address resource depletion. Over the past few years, there has been a growing recognition of the potential of agricultural crop waste in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promoting global carbon neutrality. Despite lacking practical management options, open-field burning of crop residue contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. This challenge may be addressed by producing biochar through the pyrolysis of agricultural crop residues. A biochar application in agriculture can contribute to reducing global warming through the sequestration of atmospheric carbon and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the soil. As part of the life cycle assessment of biochar, the yield and greenhouse gas emissions during its production are critical factors, which emphasize the importance of selecting a production method suitable for producing biochar. The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview of the environmental and agronomic advantages associated with biochar, along with a detailed analysis of its life cycle assessment (LCA). Furthermore, it provides an overview of how biochar can facilitate local energy production and contribute to sustainable resource management within the nexus of agroecosystems, environment, and energy."
390;Copula function with Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo for unveiling uncertainty impacts on meteorological and agricultural drought propagation;"Q. Zhang a , Y.P. Li a,b,* , G.H. Huang a,b , H. Wang a , Z.Y. Shen a";"Agricultural drought (AD) is disastrous to natural and socioeconomic systems, and the propagation of meteorological drought (MD) plays an essential role in the occurrence of AD. However, how uncertainty affects the mechanism of propagation from MD to AD remains unclear. In this study, a novel method called C-VBMC is developed through coupling copula function with Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC). The developed CVBMC is then applied to the Aral Sea Basin to demonstrate its feasibility and capability. Results indicate that the method could effectively quantify the drought propagation probability under the impact of uncertainty. Several findings can be summarized: (1) compared with the low elevation areas, the propagation time and relationship between MD and AD tend to be longer and weaker in spring and winter at mid-high elevation areas (2) drought propagation characteristics are significantly affected by seasonality, altitude, potential evapotranspiration, precipitation and soil moisture (3) the posterior distribution of copula parameter by VBMC is similar with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and VBMC only takes about 50% and 5% of the computation time required by MCMC for univariate and bivariate copula functions, the results highlight the superiority and flexibility of VBMC for large datasets (4) the probability of AD occurrence and the uncertainty range are easily affected by same and more severe level MD (5) the propagation probabilities tend to be underestimated without uncertainty impact, and the uncertainty range is lower than 0.05 for most grids. This study is helpful for drought warning management and disaster prevention systems."
391;"Analysing the waste management, industrial and agriculture greenhouse gas emissions of biomass, fossil fuel, and metallic ores utilization in Iceland";"Andrew Adewale Alola a,b,c,? , Tomiwa Sunday Adebayo d,e";"With Icelands CAP 2020, the country aims significant improvement in the state of its environment through reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission especially in energy production and small industry, waste management, ships and ports, land transport, and agriculture by 2030. Considering this ambition, this study queries whether the consumptions of domestic materials i.e., DMC (especially metallic ores, biomass, and fossil fuels) exhibit differential impact on (i) aggregated greenhouse gas emissions i.e., GHG, (ii) waste management greenhouse gas emission i.e., WGHG, (ii) industrial greenhouse gas emission i.e., IGHG, and (iv) agriculture greenhouse gas emission i.e., AGHG during the period 1990 to 2019. By using Fourier function approaches, the investigation establishes that metallic ores DMC spur GHG, but biomass and fossil fuel DMC mitigate GHG in the long run. Additionally, biomass DMC mitigates AGHG and WGHG by respective elasticities of 0.04 and 0.025 in the long run. While IGHG is significantly reduced by fossil fuel DMC with elasticity of 0.18 in the long run, the AGHG and WGHG are unaffected by the consumption of fossil fuel domestic materials. Moreover, metallic ores DMC spurs only IGHG by elasticity of ~0.24. The overall evidence shows the need for more stringent material use and resource circularity (especially for metallic ores and fossil fuels) for the country to stay on course of the CAP 2020 and maintain environmental sustainability."
392;Agricultural intensification weakens soil multifunctionality by reducing fungal diversity;"Rui Xue, Chong Wang * , Lei Zhao, Jia Cao, Mengli Liu, Dong Zhang";"Agricultural intensification is known to impact the soil microbial diversity and community structure, which are responsible for soil multifunctionality. Although the contributions of fungal and bacterial diversity to soil multifunctionality in natural ecosystems have been extensively studied, little is known about the research in intensive agroecosystems. Therefore, intensively-managed farmland, farmland abandoned 10 years and farmland abandoned for 44 years investigated as a gradient of intensity of farmland management. The results showed that agricultural intensification reduced fungal Shannon diversity and weakened soil multifunctionality. Fungal diversity was the major driver of soil multifunctionality. Structural equation modeling was used to identify the effects of soil abiotic properties (soil organic carbon and soil total nitrogen), and fungal and bacterial communities on multifunctionality. Our model predicted 64.0 % of the variation in soil multifunctionality, and confirmed that fungal diversity was positively associated with multifunctionality. These results suggest that sustaining microbial diversity, especially fungal diversity might be a means of reducing the effect of agricultural intensification on soil multifunctionality."

Spielman a , Martin Paul Jr Tabe-Ojong b";"Despite enthusiasm for the potential of digital innovations to transform agricultural markets in Africa, progress made thus far has been limited to small-scale experiments that often fail to scale up. Realizing the full potential of digital innovations ? tools, technologies, applications, and services ? in Africa requires not just further development of these solutions at meaningful scales, but also more nuanced evidence from both successful and unsuccessful scaling efforts. This paper reviews the conceptual and empirical evidence on the transformative potential of digital innovations for African agricultural markets with an in-depth examination of solutions that have been rolled out to date in the continent. Specifically, the review addresses the following questions: (i) how can digital innovations improve the functioning of agricultural markets in Africa? (ii) what explains the apparent disconnect of most pilots to scale-ups? (iii) what is required to realize their full potential? and (iv) what are the emerging risks and opportunities associated with digital innovations for agricultural marketing? Although our review of the landscape and literature on market-focused digital innovations in Africa identifies several reasons to remain optimistic, the prevailing disconnect between pilots and scale-ups merits further evaluation. In particular, there is a need for more systematic assessments of both successes and failures at both the piloting and scaling stages."
395;The versatility of green synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles in sustainable agriculture: A review on metal-microbe interaction that rewards agriculture;"Ankita Gauba a,1 , Sharath Kumar Hari a,1 , Vellaisamy Ramamoorthy b , Shanmugaiah Vellasamy a,**, Ganesan Govindan c , M. Valan Arasu d,";"The integration of nanotechnology in the realm of agriculture, specifically through the utilization of nanofertilizers and nanopesticides, has been a topic of increasing interest in recent years. The application of fertilizers in the form of nanoparticles is one of the most promising solutions for the significant enhancement of agricultural production worldwide. This review highlights the versatility of green synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) in sustainable agriculture and their interactions with plant-microbe systems. ZnONPs have been classified as a biosafe substance for biological species. Previous research has revealed the efficacy of ZnONPs in the induction of seed germination and plant growth, as well as its potential for biological control through its antimicrobial activities. However, it is important to note that the effects of ZnONPs on plant growth and metabolism can vary depending on the developmental phase of the plant. Furthermore, the uptake, transport and aggregation of ZnONPs by plants are dependent on the characteristics of the NPs and the morphology of the host plant. However, the use of ZnONPs in agriculture also poses some potential adverse effects, including toxicity to non-target organisms, accumulation in the food chain, and environmental pollution. These effects are influenced by various factors such as particle size, concentration, and exposure time. Thus, the review discusses the current knowledge on the toxicity and environmental impact of ZnONPs in agriculture and their potential mitigation strategies. Furthermore, this review aims to comprehensively highlight the potential applications of ZnONPs as a nanofertilizer in crop production, as well as to explore and understand the possible mechanisms of its antimicrobial activity. Additionally, the biological production of ZnONPs, its absorption, transport mechanisms, phytoremediation of heavy metals in plants and toxicity studies are also investigated."
396;Accelerating agriculture: Data-intensive plant breeding and the use of genetic gain as an indicator for agricultural research and development;"Hugh F. Williamson * , Sabina Leonelli";"Accelerating the rate of genetic gain has in recent years become a key objective in plant breeding for the Global South, building on the availability of new data technologies and bridging biological interest in crop improvement with economic interest in enhancing the cost efficiency of breeding programs. This paper explains the concept of genetic gain, the conditions for its emerging status as an indicator of agricultural development and the broader implications of this move, with particular emphasis on the changing knowledge-control regimes of plant breeding, the social and political consequences for smallholder farmers and climate-adaptive agriculture. We analyse how prioritising the variables used to derive the indicator when deciding on agricultural policies affects the relationship between development goals and practice. We conclude that genetic gain should not be considered as a primary indicator of agricultural development in the absence of information on other key areas (including agrobiodiversity, seed systems and the differential impact of climate change on soil, crops and communities), as well as tools to evaluate the pros and cons of the acceleration in seed selection, management and evaluation fostered by the adoption of genetic gain as a key indicator."

399;An empirical analysis on adoption of precision agricultural techniques among farmers of Punjab for efficient land administration;"Abhishek Khanna a,* , Sanmeet Kaur b";"Agriculture plays a vital role in building the nation?s economy. To enhance the country?s financial standings, it is essential for farmers adopt innovative agricultural techniques/practices. Over the years, a rapid growth has been experienced within this domain by virtue of adapting agricultural sensors, drones, Global Positing Systems (GPS), and other integrated devices. However, adaptation of newer practices is completely overlooked by most farmers across the state of Punjab in the Indian sub-continent. It has been visualized that farmers across the state are hesitant to adapt precision agricultural practices. This is mainly due to several constraints that are encountered by the farmers across the state, i.e., non-awareness of the concept among farmers, financial limitations, and other associated factors within the domain. Hence, to clearly understand the mindset of the farmers and their perception towards the adaption of precision agriculture techniques, the authors have prepared a structured questionnaire that consisted of 30 questions. The questionnaire was prepared to capture farmers? basic tendency towards various hurdles that farmers encounter while adopting precision agricultural practices. Responses of 342 farmers across the state of Punjab was taken under consideration to further evaluate the mindset of farmers on the following key points, i.e., Various parameters such as basic knowledge on the usability of agricultural sensors, expectation level of farmers towards adaptation of agricultural sensors, and support from the state government, issues related to cost of agricultural sensors, and issues related practical implementation of agricultural sensors. To evaluate the responses, One-way ANOVA and Independent-sample T-test were analyzed over Statistical Packages for Social Science (SPSS) Version 22. In addition, descriptive analysis (on individual responses) has been presented within the results section and coefficient of correlation (r) has also been has also been calculated to identify the degree of relationship among dependent and independent variables. f-distribution results obtained over SPSS software depicted a positive inclination among farmers towards usage and adaptation of newer farming concepts, provided some constraints needed to be addressed with a pragmatic approach. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the reasons for the shortcomings for non-adaptability of modern day agricultural practices among farmers and to bridge a gap among farmers and state/central government on motivating and providing all sorts of possible assistance in adopting precision agricultural practices with an aim to make effective use of land and enhancing production scale."

Annual data from 2000 to 2021 was collected from the World Bank? official data bank portal. Statistical techniques and Graphical illustrations were applied to understand the impacts of economic variables on methane and CO2 emissions on the bioeconomy. The highest positive correlation (0.98) was observed between CO2 emissions and Research & Development, followed by a strong negative correlation (- 0.97) between methane emissions and agricultural land. The Support Vector Regression (SVR) model was applied to analyze the non-linear relationship of economic factors with CO2 and methane emissions and prediction models for the emissions of methane and CO2 in China. The SVR results revealed a strongly non-linear association between CO2 and methane emissions and agricultural economic parameters. Due to the sustainable development policy, the forecasting approach demonstrates that these emissions will be constant in China for the next 10 years. This paper will assist the government and policymakers in understanding the role of the agricultural sector and its contributing factors to increasing CO2 and methane emissions along with their part in the economy, international trade, and environmental pollution."
401;A parsimonious model for predicting the NO3 - -N concentration in shallow groundwater in intensive agricultural areas using few easily accessible indicators and small datasets based on machine learning;"Panlei Wang a,1 , Dan Zhang b,1 , Xiang Tao c , Wanli Hu a , Bin Fu a , Hui Yan a , Yanhua Pan a , Anqiang Chen a";"Groundwater nitrate poses a health risk to humans, and monitoring groundwater quality is time-consuming and expensive. To improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of monitoring groundwater nitrate, a parsimonious model was developed using easily accessible predictors and small datasets based on random forest (RF), neural network (NN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. Groundwater NO3 - -N concentrations of 1196 groundwater samples from intensive agricultural areas along with data on 13 predictors were obtained for the construction of prediction models. R2 and RMSE metrics were used to evaluate the models, with an emphasis on a minimal number of predictors and a low data size. The results showed that even with few readily available predictors (conductivity, EC chemical nitrogen fertilization rate, NF and precipitation, PPT) and a small dataset (260?700 observations), the three models achieved good precision, with R2 and RMSE values of 0.70?0.80 and 6.87?8.13, respectively. In these prediction models, EC was the primary predictor acting as an intrinsic factor, NF acted as a loading factor to supplement the blind area of EC for NO3 - -N prediction, and PPT was introduced because of its accessibility to improve predictive performance. The final predictors applied in this study link the two currently dominant prediction methods by combining the high predictive accuracy of the intrinsic predictor with the accessibility of the extrinsic predictor, and the results demonstrate the practicability and applicability advantages of this model in groundwater NO3 - -N prediction. This model provides technical support for the rapid and low-cost realization of the online monitoring of NO3 - -N pollution in shallow groundwater in intensive agricultural areas."
402;Simulation of climate warming and agricultural land expansion for sustainable lake fish catch in high-latitude agricultural regions;"Xuemei Liu a , Liwen Chen a,b,* , Guangxin Zhang a,* , Jingjie Zhang a,c , Jingshuang Yang d , Fengmin Ma d , Kuijuan Sun d";"Global sustainable fisheries play an important role towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. However, to the best of our knowledge, previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of climate and land use change on fish catch, lacking a systematic understanding of the driving mechanisms and restriction threshold value, especially in high-latitude lakes. In this study, a novel approach that combined Bayesian Modeling (BNM) with remote sensing was developed to identify the drivers and determine the threshold of climate warming and agricultural land expansion. Our results demonstrate that air temperature (ATP) and agricultural land use (ALU) are key factors resulting in the reduction of fish catch, while relative humidity index (RHI) may only play a minor role. Compared with the mean value of the fish catch between 2004 and 2019, increasing 2.5 ?C would result in significant decrease in the fish catch. The increasing of 14.41% expansion of agricultural land use would also lead to a significant decline in the fish catch. The purposed multi-dimensional water management strategies that can balance the economic development and ecosystem health in terms of agri-food system towards achieving a blue transformation and improving fisheries management. The framework we developed in this study can also be applied in other similar regions globally."
403;Dynamic evolution and decoupling analysis of agricultural nonpoint source pollution in Taihu Lake Basin during the urbanization process;"Dongying Sun a,* , Xiaoxu Wang a , Mengling Yu a , Zhaolin Ouyang a , Gang Liu b";"In recent years, as control of industrial point source pollution has gradually increased, agricultural nonpoint source pollution (ANPSP) has become an important focus of water pollution control. ANPSP is closely related to challenges in the urbanization process, though urbanization has mitigated water pollution control to a certain extent. In this study, taking the Taihu Lake Basin of China as an example, the dynamic interrelation between urbanization and ANPSP is macroscopically displayed by the Vector autoregressive (VAR) model, and the coevolution characteristics of the two are quantitatively measured by the decoupling index. Then, the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method is used to explore the influence of urbanizations accompanying effects, including pollution intensity, economic structure, output level and population factors, on ANPSP. The results showed that (1) since 2006, total nitrogen (TN) has continued to decline, while total phosphorus (TP) initially increased then decreased. The main pollution sources were livestock and poultry breeding and planting, which showed a trend of alternating growth and decline. At the same time, the contributions of rural life and aquaculture to pollution gradually increased. (2) Urbanization has a positive effect on ANPSP control after reaching a certain stage, but there is a possibility of pollution rebound urbanization mitigates ANPSP, but still contributes to environmental pollution. (3) The decoupling between urbanization and ANPSP is achieved across the basin. However, the decoupling level between TP and urbanization lagged behind the decoupling level between TN and urbanization. Meanwhile, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the TP decoupling index is more evident than that of the TN index. (4) The intensity effect and structure effect promote the strong decoupling between urbanization and ANPSP, while the output effect and population effect make the decoupling relationship evolve to adverse states such as expansive negative decoupling and expansive coupling."
404;A deep learning framework for crop mapping with reconstructed Sentinel-2 time series images;"Fukang Feng a , Maofang Gao a,* , Ronghua Liu b , Shuihong Yao a , Guijun Yang c,d";"Timely and accurate access to regional scale crop plant area and spatial distribution is essential for regional agricultural production and food security, especially in the context of global population growth and climate change. Deep learning has become prevalent in crop mapping under complex conditions due to its powerful feature extraction and nonlinear ability. This study proposes a time-series image classification framework using Attention-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (A-BiGRU) to map rice, maize, and soybean in Fujin, China, from reconstructed Sentinel-2 time-series images. Firstly, the reconstructed Sentinel-2 time-series images with 10 spectral dimensions and 22 temporal dimensions were obtained by linear interpolation and Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter. Then, a neural network, the A-BiGRU was developed to identify different crops by taking advantage of their unique growth patterns. The attention mechanism enables temporal neural networks to focus on the critical growth periods of crops. Additionally, the structure of GRU is simpler than that of long short-term memory (LSTM) and simple recurrent neural network (SRNN), which reduces the number of parameters and alleviates overfitting. Compared to GRU, BiGRU can fully uses the time-series information of the entire crop growth cycle. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared two deep learning methods (LSTM and SRNN) and three widely used non-deep learning classifiers (Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM), Support Vector Machine (SVM)) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The results demonstrate that A-BiGRU achieved the highest accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 0.9804, a macro F1 score of 0.9788 and a kappa score of 0.9714. We also selected four typical regions and compared the classification results with optical images, which showed that the proposed method has a good recognition effect. Therefore, the A-BiGRU method is capable of achieving highprecision crop mapping."
405;Tech-economic modeling and analysis of agricultural photovoltaic-water systems for irrigation in arid areas;"Yamin Yan a , Yan Wang b , Jie Yan a,* , Zhengguang Liu c,**, Qi Liao b , Bohong Wang d";"Affected by the shortage of water resources and land degradation, the sustainable development of agriculture in more and more arid areas will face serious obstacles. The combinations of agricultural photovoltaic, water transportation and irrigation systems are considered as a potential choice to solve above problem. This study aims to investigate the competitiveness of various system configurations to transport water from water resource to agricultural irrigation systems driven by the output power of agricultural photovoltaic. Including the levelized cost of electricity and net present value, a comprehensive techno-economic assessment model is proposed to analyze the agricultural photovoltaic and irrigation systems in arid areas for six scenarios. The applicability of the proposed model in managing regional water and renewable energy nexus systems was tested through application to a real-world case study in the Gansu province, China. Assuming that the baseline transportation distance is 50 km, the results show that exporting water to farmland through electric water trucks shows the best economic performance with the net present value of 13.71 MU$, and every 10 km increase in the transportation distance can decrease the net present value by 1.32 MU$. An important finding is that when the transportation distance was greater than 100 km, pipeline transportation mode was more economical than electric water truck transportation mode. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to analyze the electricity and water prices, farmland size, photovoltaic efficiency on the economic performance of these systems. Results show that only when the electricity price was greater than 0.08 $/kWh, pipeline transport mode yielded positive benefits, and every 0.1$/m3 increase in the water price can increase the net present value by 0.2 MU$."
406;The sustainability of desalination as a remedy to the water crisis in the agriculture sector: An analysis from the climate-water-energy-food nexus perspective;"Babak Zolghadr-Asli a,b,*,1 , Neil McIntyre a,c , Slobodan Djordjevic b , Raziyeh Farmani b , Liliana Pagliero a";"Over the years, desalination has become integral to water resources management, primarily in coastal semi-arid to arid regions. While desalinated seawater has mainly been supplied to municipal and high-revenue industries, the agriculture sector faces increasing irrigation demands, making it a potential user. This review assesses the sustainability of using desalinated seawater for irrigation, shedding light on its limitations and potential. Using desalinated water for irrigation presents challenges, including its high energy consumption, potential contribution to climate change, and agronomy-related concerns. However, evidence suggests that these challenges can be addressed effectively through tailor-fitted strategies. That said, conventional binary decision-making paradigms that label practices as good or bad and focus on a singular, isolated aspect are insufficient for evaluating the sustainability of desalination due to the complex and interconnected nature of the issues involved. To overcome this, the climate-water-energy-food (CWEF) nexus concept is proposed as a comprehensive framework for sustainability assessment. Adopting the CWEF nexus approach allows for a better understanding of the potential challenges associated with using desalinated water for irrigation, encompassing social, economic and environmental concerns. To ensure effective management of these challenges, it is crucial to tailor desalination projects to specific regional conditions and employ either prophylactic or corrective strategies. By embracing the CWEF nexus approach, informed decisions can be made regarding the future utilization of desalinated water for irrigation, contributing to broader sustainability goals."
407;Monitoring shifting cultivation in Laos with Landsat time series;"Shijuan Chen a,b,* , Pontus Olofsson a , Thatheva Saphangthong c , Curtis E. Woodcock a";"Shifting cultivation is an agricultural practice in which plots of land are cultivated temporarily, then abandoned, and vegetation is allowed to regenerate during fallow periods. Shifting cultivation is usually associated with cutting and burning forests and thus it is an important driver of forest disturbance in the tropics. However, studies of shifting cultivation are limited, and current area estimates of shifting cultivation are highly uncertain. Although Southeast Asia is a hotspot of shifting cultivation, there are no national maps of shifting cultivation in Southeast Asia at moderate or high resolution (less than or equal to 30 m). Monitoring shifting cultivation is challenging because it is highly dynamic, small-scale and results in complex post-disturbance landscapes. In this study, we monitored shifting cultivation using Landsat time series on Google Earth Engine for the entire country of Laos from 1991 to 2020. First, CCDC-SMA (Continuous Change Detection and Classification - Spectral Mixture Analysis) was used to detect forest disturbances. Then, these disturbances were attributed by combining time series analysis, object-based image analysis (OBIA), and post-disturbance land cover classification. Forest disturbances were assigned to Shifting cultivation, New plantation, Deforestation, Severe Drought, and Subtle Disturbance annually from 1991 to 2020 at a 30-m resolution. The major forest disturbances in 1991?2020 were mapped with an overall accuracy of 85%. Shifting cultivation is mapped with a producer?s accuracy of 88% and a user?s accuracy of 80%. The margin of error of the sampling-based area estimates of Shifting cultivation is 5.9%. Shifting cultivation is the main land use in Laos, accounting for 32.9% ? 1.9% of Laos over the past 30 years. To study changes in shifting cultivation over time, the area of shifting cultivation was estimated at 5-year intervals between 1991 and 2020 with all margins of error <17%. Results show that the area of slash-and-burn activities in Laos increased in 2015?2020. Our study provides an effective approach for monitoring shifting cultivation, which can be potentially applied into other regions. Our results not only provide valuable information for land management in Laos, but also can support analysis of spatial-temporal patterns of shifting cultivation and estimation of carbon emissions associated with shifting cultivation for REDD+ reporting."
408;Mapping bare ground in New Zealand hill-country agriculture and forestry for soil erosion risk assessment: An automated satellite remote-sensing method;"Heather North a,* , Alexander Amies a , John Dymond b , Stella Belliss a , David Pairman a , John Drewry b , Jan Schindler c , James Shepherd b";"Removing vegetation cover from hill-slope land increases risk for soil erosion and delivery of sediment to waterways. In New Zealand?s productive landscapes, clear-fell harvesting of forestry blocks and winter forage grazing by agricultural livestock are two significant causes of vegetation removal. Bare ground exposed by these activities varies annually and seasonally in location and spatial extent. Modelling soil erosion therefore requires temporally and spatially explicit mapping of this bare ground. We have developed an automated mapping method using time-series satellite imagery, thereby enabling wide-area coverage and ease of updating. The temporal analysis identifies land use along with the period of vegetation removal. It produces results per land parcel (in vector format) for use in a Geographic Information System. We present a description of our method, national maps and statistics of bare ground extent in New Zealand?s hill-country forestry and winter forage grazing land in 2018, and an assessment of accuracy. The attributes of the mapped land parcels are designed for input into a soil erosion estimation model such as the New Zealand Universal Soil Loss Equation."
409;A framework combined stacking ensemble algorithm to classify crop in complex agricultural landscape of high altitude regions with Gaofen-6 imagery and elevation data;"Zhiyuan Ma a , Wei Li a , Timothy A. Warner b , Can He a , Xue Wang a , Yu Zhang a , Caili Guo a , Tao Cheng a , Yan Zhu a , Weixing Cao a , Xia Yao a,";"Mapping crop distribution using satellite technology is an effective approach for gaining information about food production over broad, regional scales. However, crop classification in high altitude regions from satellite platforms remains challenging, due to the spatial heterogeneity caused by the complex planting patterns. Moreover, the frequent cloud cover makes it difficult to collect time-series imagery for these regions. Thus, this study used a mosaic of single images of Gaofen-6 data to map the crop distribution in high altitude regions of Xining City and Haidong City prefectures of Qinghai Province, China. To improve the accuracy of the crop classification, random forest-recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) was used to determine an optimal feature subset from existing spectral, texture and topographic features. Then, a two-layer stacking generalization ensemble model, incorporating Random Forest, XGBoost and AdaBoost, was trained. The results reveal that the stacking algorithm outperformed the other single classifiers, with overall accuracy higher than 85% (87.89% for the optimal feature subset and 85.38% for the original spectral band subset). In addition, the user?s and producer?s accuracies for wheat, rape and maize field all exceeded 90%. Elevation was the variable with the highest importance score, illustrating its importance in crop classification of high altitude regions. Overall, the framework, combining RF-RFE and a stacking algorithm, can improve the accuracy of the crop classification in high altitude regions."
410;Decoding technological frames: An exploratory study of access to and meaningful engagement with digital technologies in agriculture;"Karen G. Eng?, Jawwad Z. Raja * , Isabelle Fabienne Neufang";"Technological advancements undoubtedly impact development in the agricultural industry. However, the digital divide may constrain access to technology in developing countries. Hence, there is a need to explore and understand how different actors make sense of technological advancement for a more meaningful engagement with new technology. To this end, we undertook an exploratory study of an agricultural ecosystem in Brazil comprising a heterogeneous set of actors with varying experiences of digital technologies. Our findings show the essential role of actors technological frames, and how the type of access to digital technologies influences their development toward digital agriculture. Different actors are found to react to technologies depending on their past experiences and future expectations, leading them to mobilize different framing tactics to respond to the changes that digital agriculture presents. We illuminate how the digital divide not only constrains access to digital technologies but also limits meaningful engagement. We contribute by showing how engaging in framing tactics can advance or preserve actors technological frames in the digital divide. Our study details implications for both practitioners and policymakers for future consideration."
411;Incorporating fire-smartness into agricultural policies reduces suppression costs and ecosystem services damages from wildfires;"Judit Lecina-Diaz a,b,c,* , Mar?-Luisa Chas-Amil d , N?ia Aquilu?e e,f , Angelo ? Sil b,c,g,h , Llu? Brotons e,i,j , Adrian ? Regos b,c,e,k , Julia Touza l";"In southern Europe, land abandonment and an unbalanced investment toward fire suppression instead of prevention has gradually increased wildfire risk, which calls for a paradigm change in fire management policies. Here we combined scenario analysis, fire landscape modelling, and economic tools to identify which land-use policies would reduce the expected wildfire-related losses in the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve ?Ger?esXur?es? (Spain-Portugal). To do so, we applied the least-cost-plus-net-value-change approach and estimated net changes in wildfire damages based on their implications for the 2010?2050 period and five ecosystem services: agriculture, pasture, timber, recreation and climate regulation. Four land-use scenarios were considered: (1) Business as Usual (BAU) (2) fire-smart, fostering more fire-resistant (less flammable) and/or fire-resilient landscapes (fire-smart) (3) High Nature Value farmlands (HNVf), wherein the abandonment of extensive agriculture is reversed and (4) a combination of HNVf and fire-smart. HNVf is the best scenario for suppression cost savings, but it generates the lowest net present value of societal benefits from climate regulation. In fact, the most efficient scenario with the lowest societal discounted net suppression costs and change on ecosystem services damages is the HNVf + fire-smart scenario, as it also generates suppression cost savings from agricultural expansion, and lead to a significant reduction in damages on timber and recreational benefits. Therefore, reverting land abandonment through recultivation and promoting fire-resistant tree species is the most efficient way to reduce wildfire hazard. In this sense, payments for ecosystem services should reward farmers and landowners for their role in wildfire prevention. This study improves the understanding of the financial and societal benefits derived from reducing fire suppression spending and ecosystem services damage by undertaking fire-smart land-use strategies, which can be essential to enhance local stakeholders? support for Payments of Ecosystem Services policies for wildfire prevention."
412;Voter evaluations regarding the tradeoffs between agricultural production and water quality in Lake Erie;"Richard T. Melstrom a,* , Trey Malone b";"This research note examines public support for policies to regulate and incentivize pollution control in the farm sector to protect water quality in the western basin of Lake Erie. We conducted an experiment in which local residents indicated whether a policy was fair depending on whether it targeted waste from animal feeding operations or fertilizer runoff from crop farms and if it used regulations or incentives. We then asked how they would vote in a referendum on the policy. Our results show that while support for such policies is widespread, residents are most willing to support regulating fertilizer runoff (i.e. nonpoint source pollution) from crop farms."
413;"A monitoring, reporting and verification system for low carbon agriculture: A case study from Brazil";"Bruno Perosa a,* , Peter Newton b , Ramon Felipe Bicudo da Silva c,d";"Low carbon agricultural techniques, which aim to reduce agricultural emissions without compromising productivity, are being widely adopted as one strategy to promote more sustainable food systems. Evaluating the impact of such practices requires an effective monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system. To our knowledge, no MRV system has been designed or implemented for monitoring and measuring the impacts of the adoption of low carbon agricultural practices. The goal of this paper is to explore the opportunities and challenges of developing a large scale MRV system for low carbon agriculture in Brazil - a major global food producer. The analysis presented in this paper is based on primary data, collected through interviews and conversations with experts, and secondary data from a literature review as well as from public and private databases. Hence, we discuss the three phases of monitoring, reporting and verification. In each case, we analyze the informational needs of an MRV system, evaluate the strengths and limitations of available tools to collect and process these data, and present a vision of how these constituent parts could form a comprehensive MRV system for Brazil. Our analysis reveals technical and governance challenges. On the technical side, challenges include the need to develop emissions factors to calculate mitigation across a range of biomes and low carbon agricultural techniques, and the high costs of gathering and verifying information on farm level. On the governance side, there is a need to generate economic incentives for farmers to share private, farm-level data with a public MRV system. The MRV system could help producers to demonstrate adoption and mitigation, giving them improved access to low-interest credit or certification programs. We conclude that the implementation of a large scale MRV system for low carbon agriculture demands an integrative approach based on a hybrid public-private governance system that prioritizes cost-effectiveness and facilitates smooth information transfer."
414;Evapotranspiration partitioning and agricultural drought quantification with an optical trapezoidal framework;"Ngoc My Nguyen a,b , Minha Choi c,d,";"The Optical Trapezoidal method is a recently proposed method using solely optical remote sensing data with promising potential in hydroclimatic applications however, its application in evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning is still questionable. This study therefore improved an Optical Trapezoidal-based Evaporative Fraction (OPTREF) model reliant on the physical association between soil surface properties and shortwave infrared transformed reflectance (STR). The proposed model was parameterized using trapezoidal shapes formed by STR and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) retrieved from Sentinel-2 to compute contribution of transpiration to ET (T/ET) in the Central Valley region of California, United States. Results indicated that the OPTREF model efficiently captured regional plant characteristics and seasonal variation of T/ET for three typical land cover types in study region (cropland, grassland, and savanna), particularly T/ET discrepancies rising from alternative cropping systems in cropland. Importantly, predicted T/ET values were in good agreement with previous modelling and empirical reports for example, T/ET ranges in [0.37-0.75] for cropland, [0.30-0.82] for grassland, and [0.39-0.77] for savanna. In addition, applicability of the OPTREF approach was investigated in tracking agricultural drought using evaporative drought index (EDI), together with analysis of physiological response of T/ET to drought. The OPTREF-based EDI consistently reflected the same drought patterns indicated by records of vegetation health index and drought area percentages data from NOAA. Also, our findings uncovered that under extreme drought, the T/ET ratio is likely to increase and might be approximately equal to 1.0 in areas covered by drought-tolerant plants. Overall, this OPTREF approach offers novelty, simplicity, and versatility to satellite-based remote sensing of ET partitioning and identifying agricultural drought, especially in the context of rapid climate variation."
415;Dynamic impact of negative public sentiment on agricultural product prices during COVID-19;"Yunqiang Liu a,1 , Sha Liu a,1 , Deping Ye a , Hong Tang a,b , Fang Wang a,";"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significantly negative impact on public sentiment, which has resulted in panic and some irrational buying behavior, which in turn has had a complex impact on agricultural product prices. This study quantified online negative sentiment using micro-blog text mining and a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model (TVP-VAR) to empirically analyze the dynamic impact of negative public emotions on agricultural product prices during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. It was found that the online negative sentiment impacted agricultural products prices during COVID-19 and had significant time-varying, lag, and life cycle characteristics, with the responses being most significant in the spread and recession periods. Differences were found in the price responses for different agricultural products and in different risk areas. The online negative sentiment was found to have the greatest impact on vegetable prices, with livestock products and vegetable prices being mainly positively impacted, fruit prices being mainly negatively impacted, and aquatic product prices being negatively impacted in the early stage and positively impacted in the middle and late stages. The online negative sentiment had the greatest impact on medium-risk area agricultural product prices, followed by low-risk areas, with the lowest impact found on the high-risk area agricultural product prices. Three policy suggestions for epidemic monitoring, public opinion guidance and control, and the timely release of agricultural product information are given based on the results."
416;Is the technical efficiency green? The environmental efficiency of agricultural production in the MENA region;"Wei Huang a,* , Qian Liu b , Assem Abu Hatab a,c,d,";"There is widespread recognition of the global environmental impact of agricultural production on greenhouse gas emissions, but evidence is sparse regarding the impact in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In this study, we treat agricultural emissions as an undesirable output from agricultural production and apply the directional distance function to measure environmentally-adjusted technical efficiency, defined as environmental efficiency in agricultural production, in six countries in the MENA region (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia) during the period 1980?2016. The results show that all six countries have clear scope to improve their environmental efficiency. Agricultural production is greener in Jordan and Israel, while environmental efficiency is currently lowest in Egypt and Morocco. Estimated relative shadow price of agricultural emissions is - 1.002, implying that the ?cost? of removing agricultural emissions is almost equal to the value of producing one unit of good output. These findings suggest there is a trade-off between agriculture emissions and production, which should be considered in efforts to enhance the sustainability of agricultural production in the MENA region."
417;"Characterising cropland fragmentation in post-Soviet Central Asia, using Landsat remote-sensing time series data";"Christoph Raab a,b,* , Michael Spies a";"Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, agricultural reforms in Central Asia often translated into the fragmentation of large fields into smaller shares. Most remote-sensing-based land use classification approaches are categorical in nature, and thus they are unable to capture these changes. We have developed an approach to detecting the timing of land fragmentation based on textural information from a time series of Landsat images for four Central Asian countries (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) between 1990 and 2019. Our results showed that detected fragmentation events correspond well with documented agrarian reform processes in the different countries, and validation yielded maximum overall accuracies between 67 and 73%. In a case study of a former collective farm in Kyrgyzstan, we demonstrate how our method can accurately detect changes on the local scale. Texture time series data have great potential for analysing the trajectories of cropland fragmentation, in particular in regions where additional information on land use is limited."
418;The impact of silver nanoparticles on the growth of plants: The agriculture applications;"Sajad Khan a , Muhammad Zahoor b,* , Raham Sher Khan a , Muhammad Ikram c , Noor Ul Islam d";"Nanotechnology is the most advanced and rapidly progressing field of science and technology. It primarily deals with developing novelty in nanomaterials by understanding and controlling matter at the nanoscale level. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are the most prominent nanoparticles incorporated with wide-ranging applications, owing to their distinct characteristics. Different methods have been employed for nanoparticles synthesis like chemical method, physical method, photochemical method, top-down/bottom-up approach and biological methods. The positive impacts of silver nanoparticles have been observed in various economy-based sectors, including agriculture. The scientific curiosity about AgNPs in agriculture and plant biotechnology has shown optimum efficacy over the last few years. It not only enhances seed germination and plant growth, but also improves the quantum efficiency of the photosynthetic process. AgNPs play a vital role in agriculture by having several applications that are crucial for ensuring food security and improving crop production. Moreover, they also act as nano-pesticides, providing sufficient dose to the target plants without releasing unnecessary pesticides into the environment. Nanofertilizers slowly release nutrients to the plants, thereby preventing excessive nutrient loss. AgNPs are utilized for effective and non-toxic pest management, making them an excellent tool for combating pests safely. They combine either edible or non-biodegradable polymers for active food packaging. In addition, AgNPs also possess diverse biological properties such as antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal activities, which protect plants from hazardous microbes. The aim of this review is to comprehensively survey and summarize recent literature regarding the positive and negative impacts of AgNPs on plant growth, as well as their agricultural applications."
419;Crop type mapping in the central part of the North China Plain using Sentinel-2 time series and machine learning;"Ke Luo a,b,c , Linlin Lu b,c,* , Yanhua Xie d , Fang Chen b,c , Fang Yin e , Qingting Li f";"The North China Plain (NCP), a major agricultural area in China, plays an important role in China?s grain production. Timely and accurate crop information for NCP is very important to China?s food security and sustainable development. Due to high variability of the temporal profiles of vegetation indices, classification models using temporally aggregated remote sensing data often exhibit suboptimal performance for multi-crop classification in the NCP with complex cropping patterns. Therefore, optimal feature sets and classification models should be developed for efficient and accurate crop mapping in this region. In this study, we used all available Sentinel-2 imagery in 2020 to map major crops including winter wheat/corn, cotton, peanut, and millet in a typical winter wheat production city in the central part of the NCP. NDVI time series, textural, and phenological features from Sentinel-2 time series and topographic features of the study area were derived as input features (394 features in total). Two feature selection methods, random forest and unsupervised feature selection based on multi-subspace randomization and collaboration (SRCFS), were used to select 20 informative features from the 394 features. Then, four groups of features were evaluated with three machine learning classifiers, i.e., random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). The results showed that the most useful features for crop type classification for the region were phenological and textural features during February to March and April to May. When using the full feature set, RF provided the best results compared with SVM and ANN. However, both RF and SVM classifier with 20 RF-selected features generated the optimal results. The crops were identified with an overall accuracy of 93% and a kappa coefficient of 0.9 in the final 10-meter resolution crop map. The feature selection and machine learning classification methods can be applied to highresolution crop mapping using time series of Sentinel-2 data in agricultural regions with mixed cropping patterns in an efficient manner."

Daniel a , John Richendrfer b , Ronald Falta a , Lawrence Murdoch a , Henry Lin c,1 , Christophe J.G. Darnault a,";"The Living Filter at Pennsylvania State University in Central Pennsylvania receives on average 1.5 million gallons per day (MGD) of secondary treated wastewater effluent year-round since 1962. The objective of this study was to identify and relate any bedrock fracture traces and surface depressions to any surficial or geomorphologic processes currently underway as a result of irrigation. The Living Filter is underlain by a massive dolomite with fractures trending near N-S that were previously documented using photogrammetry. A manual process was developed in order to determine the trend and location of several fracture traces within the Astronomy site section of the Living Filter. A semi-automated isolation scheme was next used to identify and correlate closed depressions to the location of fracture traces in the Living Filter. A predominant but slight NE-SW trend was observed among fractures at N5E in the area north of the Pennsylvania Furnace Anticline. A high occurrence of depressions was noted in the area of fractures compared to non-fractured bedrock. The depressions in this area were found to have a net gain of 8000 ft2 , the result of which was from the net loss of 5000 ft2 within the agricultural portion of the site and a net gain of 13,000 ft2 within the forested portion of the site. Cross sections of several depressions within cropped areas indicated a lower angle slope corresponding to a V-shape while depressions within forested areas were characterized by a traditional U-shape and previously established steeper slope. These findings will enhance the current understanding of the different morphologic characteristics of both forested and agricultural depressions in karst topography. The workflows implemented here can be implemented in similar sites that display topographical variances from the bedrock fractures."

(developed by ?Ecodevelopment? enterprise), was embedded as a new module in a cloud-based farm management information system (FMIS), namely ?ifarma? (developed by ?Agrostis? enterprise). The new PreFer module preserves the full potential of the original service methodology, while taking advantage of all fundamental functionalities of the ifarma platform. PreFer as a service uses a GIS to store and process the farmers? geodatabases, which are fed from multiple sources, such as soil surveys, satellite data, yield monitors, etc. This GIS is also used to feed the machine learning algorithms of ?PreFer? with the required data to produce the prescription maps for both broadcasting and topdressing fertilizations. Then, all tables and maps are transferred from the GIS to the platform upon their production, thus becoming immediately available to the farmers. The ?ifarma/PreFer? module was tested during the 2022 cultivation season, showing that fully meets farmers? requirements. This work also indicates that synergies like this are more than necessary to create added-value in commercial precision agriculture."
422;Nutrient retention of newly restored wetlands receiving agricultural runoff in a temperate region of North America;"Bryan Page a,* , Pascal Badiou a , Owen Steele b";"Globally, eutrophication is deemed to be the greatest threat to freshwater resources and is particularly problematic for large shallow lakes where the prevalence of cyanobacterial blooms has increased in recent decades. Restored wetlands have been identified as natural infrastructure that can reduce nutrient loads from agricultural landscapes, thereby reducing eutrophication in downstream freshwater systems. While restored wetlands are generally accepted as efficient nutrient transformers and processors, there are relatively few studies that examine nutrient retention based on detailed hydrological budgets across seasons. We determined the nutrient retention capacity for phosphorus and nitrogen species of newly restored wetlands (<8 years old) receiving nonpoint source agricultural runoff over two water years. These restored wetlands are located in an intensive agricultural region that contributes to the central and western basin of Lake Erie. Two-year mean TP and TN wetland retention capacities were 11.7 ? 5.9 and 261.2 ? 112.3 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 , respectively. Two-year mean TP and TN wetland retention efficiencies were 46 ? 13 and 47 ? 8%, respectively. The mean SRP retention capacity and reduction efficiency over the two-year monitoring period were 4.8 ? 1.7 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 and 60 ? 11%, respectively. Investigating data over two water years revealed that nutrient retention was noticeably different across seasons for both TP and TN, with the highest retention occurring in summer for TP (5.7 ? 2.7 kg P ha- 1 ) and in the spring for TN (99.9 ? 50.0 kg N ha- 1 ). Our findings demonstrate that restored wetlands in agriculturally intensive temperate regions designed primarily for wildlife habitat can effectively reduce nonpoint source nutrients under a range of hydrological conditions. However, further research is needed to investigate the long-term effectiveness of restored wetlands as natural infrastructure for nutrient reduction, and to evaluate the potential environmental trade-offs and economic benefits of their implementation."
423;Transformation characteristics of organic matter and phosphorus in composting processes of agricultural organic waste: Research trends;"Shiyu Xie a , Huu-Tuan Tran b , Mingjun Pu a , Tao Zhang a,";"Agricultural waste is rich in organic matter and an important secondary source of phosphorus, which can be converted into valuable products through various technologies. Composting is an effective way to treat agricultural waste and further produce organic fertilizer, achieving waste minimization and stabilization. This paper reviews the current situation of agricultural waste pollution and composting technology, introduces the parameters that influence of the composting process and the optimal conditions, and presents the indicators for evaluating the decay of compost products and the evaluation criteria as well. In the composting process, small-molecule organic acids produced by the degradation of easily degradable organic matter such as sugars and lipids and various enzymes produced by microorganisms (phytase, phosphatase, etc.) can mineralize organic phosphorus such as phytate and phospholipids, promote phosphorus activation and provide phosphorus sources for microorganisms, so the conversion of organic matter and phosphorus is related to the fertilizer effect of composted products. Therefore, the clarification of the characteristics of organic matter and phosphorus transformation in the composting process is an important prerequisite for the resource utilization of agricultural organic waste. This paper provides theoretical support for the sustainable utilization of agricultural organic waste resources."
424;Does agricultural ecology cause environmental degradation? Empirical evidence from Bangladesh;"Shanjida Chowdhury a , Sunjida Khan b , Md Fouad Hossain Sarker c,* , Md Kabirul Islam d , Maruf Ahmed Tamal e , Niaz Ahmed Khan f";"Agricultural sector accelerates a nation?s economic growth towards sustainable development. There exists a significant relationship between agriculture and the environment. Sustainable agricultural development ensures food quality and in tandem prevents natural calamities like drought. However, in order to fulfill the food demand of a growing population, poor law quality and untenable agriculture practices arise, which in turn lead to environmental degradation. The current study explores the relationship between the agro-economic atmosphere and CO2 emissions as a measure of environmental degradation in Bangladesh between the years of 1985 and 2017. To exhibit the long-run relationship of agricultural ecology and carbon dioxide emissions, three cointegrated equations- Fully-modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), Dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS), and Canonical cointegrated regression (CCR) were assessed. For cointegration, Bayer-Hanck cointegration was implied. In long-run estimates, it was found that livestock, rice area harvested, cereal production, and other crop production impeded environmental dilapidation. The Granger Causality Test enabled unidirectional causality towards burned biomass (crop residues), the agricultural economy, and carbon emissions. Therefore, this dimension?s causality concluded that carbon dioxide emissions were caused by cereal production, other agricultural production, and agricultural land production. The overall findings of this study could potentially assist the Government of Bangladesh and the necessary authorities for implementing synchronized policies to help reduce environmental pollution and set an example for other developing nations like Bangladesh."
425;Land use classification over smallholding areas in the European Common Agricultural Policy framework;"Manuel Campos-Taberner a,* , Francisco Javier Garc?-Haro a , Beatriz Mart?ez a , Sergio Sanchez-Ruiz ? a , Alvaro ? Moreno-Mart?ez b , Gustau Camps-Valls b , Mar? Amparo Gilabert a";"Land use (LU) monitoring and mapping from remote sensing (RS) data are relevant topics in Earth observation (EO). LU monitoring requires powerful/robust classification approaches able to provide reliable identifications in decision-making applications, even over challenging areas. The European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) promotes the use of remote sensing for LU monitoring in Europe useful in the compliance control of the subsidy payments. In this context, the present study proposes a novel classification chain to identify ten land uses, namely: forest (FOR), pasture with trees (TRE), pasture with shrubs (SHR), pastureland (PAS), vineyard (VIN), arable land (ARL), fruit trees (FRU), nut trees (NUT), citrus (CIT), and olive grove (OLI), over three areas in the Valencian Autonomous Region (Spain) where smallholding farming predominates. The approach exploits the multitemporal information provided by Sentinel-2 data using a novel spatial strategy specifically designed to deal with heterogeneous agricultural areas. More precisely, we implemented a deep learning algorithm based on bidirectional recurrent neural networks to account for complex temporal dynamics. The classification results over the three areas showed accuracies higher than 95.5% over validation sets composed of in-situ checks never used during the training process. The proposed methodology outperformed standard approaches that not consider the spatial variability of the training samples, and revealed very good agreement concerning the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) of Spain. In addition, the developed chain proposes the novelty of using the kernel normalized difference vegetation index (kNDVI) as a predictor in a LU classification processing chain. Including the kNDVI instead of the traditional NDVI outperformed the classification accuracy in all metrics and classes. Ultimately, the obtained classifications were used for assessing the 2020 farmers? declarations in the three study areas. The declarations showed a level of agreement concerning the proposed approach near 99%."
426;Understanding the spatio-temporal behaviour of the sunflower crop for subfield areas delineation using Sentinel-2 NDVI time-series images in an organic farming system;Stefano Marino;"The study investigates the suitability of time series Sentinel-2 NDVI-derived maps for the subfield detection of a sunflower crop cultivated in an organic farming system. The aim was to understand the spatio-temporal behaviour of subfield areas identified by the K-means algorithm from NDVI maps obtained from satellite images and the ground yield data variability to increase the efficiency of delimiting management zones in an organic farming system. Experiments were conducted on a surface of 29 ha. NDVI time series derived from Sentinel-2 images and k-means algorithm for rapidly delineating the sunflower subfield areas were used. The crop achene yields in the whole field ranged from 1.3 to 3.77 t ha- 1 with a significant within-field spatial variability. The cluster analysis of hand-sampled data showed three subfields with achene yield mean values of 3.54 t ha- 1 (cluster 1), 2.98 t ha- 1 (cluster 2), and 2.07 t ha- 1 (Cluster 3). In the cluster analysis of NDVI data, the k-means algorithm has early delineated the subfield crop spatial and temporal yield variability. The best period for identifying subfield areas starts from the inflorescences development stage to the development of the fruit stage. Analyzing the NDVI subfield areas and yield data, it was found that cluster 1 covers an area of 42.4% of the total surface and 50% of the total achene yield cluster 2 covers 35% of both surface and yield. Instead, the surface of cluster 3 covers 22.2% of the total surface with 15% of achene yield. K-means algorithm derived from Sentinel-2 NDVI images delineates the sunflower subfield areas. Sentinel-2 images and k-means algorithms can improve an efficient assessment of subfield areas in sunflower crops. Identifying subfield areas can lead to site-specific long-term agronomic actions for improving the sustainable intensification of agriculture in the organic farming system."
427;"Prediction of the concentration of cadmium in agricultural soil in the Czech Republic using legacy data, preferential sampling, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and ensemble models";"Prince Chapman Agyeman a,* , Lubo?s Boruvka a , Ndiye Michael Kebonye b,c , Vahid Khosravi a , Kingsley John a , Ondrej Drabek a , Vaclav Tejnecky a";"The current study assesses and predicts cadmium (Cd) concentration in agricultural soil using two Cd datasets, namely legacy data (LD) and preferential sampling-legacy data (PS-LD), along with four streams of auxiliary datasets extracted from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) bands. The study was divided into two contexts: Cd prediction in agricultural soil using LD, ensemble models, 10 and 20 m spatial resolution of S2 and L8 (context 1), and Cd prediction in agricultural soil using PS-LD, ensemble models and 10 and 20 m spatial resolution of S2 and L8 (context 2). In context 1, ensemble 1, L8 with PS-LD was the cumulative optimal approach that predicted Cd in agricultural soil with a higher R2 value of 0.76, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.66, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.35, and median absolute error (MdAE) of 0.13. However, with R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.63, MAE = 0.34, and MdAE = 0.15, ensemble 1, S2 of PS-LD was the best prediction approach in predicting Cd concentration in agricultural soil in context 2. Overall, the predictions from both contexts indicated that ensemble 1 of S2 combined with PS-LD was the most appropriate and best model for Cd prediction in agricultural soil. The modeling approaches? uncertainty in both contexts was assessed using ensemble-sequential gaussian simulation (EnSGS), which revealed that the degree of uncertainty propagated in the study area was within 5% in both contexts. The combination of the PS dataset and the LD along with ensemble models and the remote sensing dataset, produced promising results. Nonetheless, the results demonstrated that the 20 m spatial resolution band dataset used in the prediction of Cd in agricultural soil outperformed the 10 m spatial resolution. When PS is combined with LD, an appropriate modeling approach, and a well-correlated remote sensing dataset are used, good results are obtained."
428;China?s agricultural assistance efficiency to Africa: Two decades of Forum for China-Africa Cooperation creation;"Ndoricimpa Sim?eon a,b,1 , Xiaoyang Li a,1,* , Sangmeng Xiao a,1";"African countries continue to import the same agricultural products that they produce locally. Africa?s dependence on food aid or importation is often a challenge to understand, considering the immense potential of its land and favorable climate for agriculture. This paper investigates whether China?s agricultural support generates positive effects on Africa despite controversial narratives. China?s agricultural assistance in Africa has aroused hope and mistrust in African peoples. Most projects that were initiated in Africa flourished at the beginning, only to collapse after the withdrawal of Chinese partners. In addition, China?s agricultural aid in Africa is perceived differently inside and outside of China. Western donors accuse China of having hidden motives behind financial aid and donations. African countries consider China?s agricultural assistance in Africa to be mutually beneficial. The international collaboration of African agriculture should prioritize sustainable impacts."
429;Deep learning for precision agriculture: A bibliometric analysis;"Solemane Coulibaly a,b,1,* , Bernard Kamsu-Foguem b,2 , Dantouma Kamissoko a , Daouda Traore a,3";"Recent advances in communication technologies with the emergence of connected objects have changed the agricultural area. In this new digital age, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, has allowed for acceleration and improvement in the processing of collected data. To highlight the evolution and advances observed in deep learning in agriculture, we conducted a bibliometric study on more than 400 recent research studies. The analyses carried out on recent research works suggest that deep learning is widely involved in the digitization of agriculture areas with high accuracy exceeding the standard image processing techniques. Most of the works focus on crop classification problems, weed, and pest identification. Their methods are mainly based on convolutional neural network architecture. From the cases study, we have identified three key challenges that are essential in the deep learning methods applied in agriculture: (i) the need to consider the perception of the domain actors, their appropriation or interaction with the existing tools (ii) the requirement to perform statistical tests to analyze the performance of the classifiers resulting from the learning process and (iii) the need to perform statistical cross-validations with the training data. In the end, we summarized the agricultural data processing process consisting of several parts, for a better consideration of the expectations resulting from the challenges addressed. We consider that this study can serve as a guideline of research for the scientist and practician in the application of deep learning methodology in agriculture."
430;"Cultured meat in cellular agriculture: Advantages, applications and challenges";"Nur Rasyidah Jahir a , Seeram Ramakrishna b , Amirul Al Ashraf Abdullah c,d,e,**, Sevakumaran Vigneswari f,";"The concept behind cellular agriculture is to produce new meat and plant product with almost little or zero meat or plant input by using their tissue or cell. It is a new approach that allows meat to be produced in a bioreactor rather than from farm animals. This concept also can be used by biotechnologists to make meat or skeletal tissue outside of an organism. The purpose of this paper is to review the types of production of cultured meat, potential benefits, and potential challenges in producing cultured meat. Two types of cultured meat production are highlighted in this review, as well as the reduction of environmental burden in food production, nutritional value, and animal welfare, as well as technical and ethical limitations in cultured meat production, public perception, and consumer acceptance of cultured meat. As a result, the concerns regarding the food supply in the face of expanding population and climate change have prompted more research on the importance of cultured meat. Cultured meat can be produced in several ways, and each has the potential to contribute to agricultural technology in ensuring food security, nutritional and hygienic requirements, and reduction of carbon. Cultured meat is a vital source of nutrition, particularly in developing nations where hunger is an issue. This review paper will assist researchers in identifying relevant information about cultured meat and the various perspective including religious perception in consuming and accepting this cultured meat."

Jones a,* , Anne L. Wilson a , Michelle C. Stanton a , J. Russell Stothard b , Federica Guglielmo a , James Chirombo c , Lindiwe Mafuleka c , Rose Oronje d , Themba Mzilahowa e,";"Infectious diseases are emerging at an unprecedented rate while food production intensifies to keep pace with population growth. Large-scale irrigation schemes have the potential to permanently transform the landscape with health, nutritional and socio-economic benefits yet, this also leads to a shift in land-use patterns that can promote endemic and invasive insect vectors and pathogens. The balance between ensuring food security and preventing emerging infectious disease is a necessity yet the impact of irrigation on vector-borne diseases at the epidemiological, entomological and economic level is uncertain and depends on the geographical and climatological context. Here, we highlight the risk factors and challenges facing vector-borne disease surveillance and control in an emerging agricultural ecosystem in the lower Shire Valley region of southern Malawi. A phased large scale irrigation programme (The Shire Valley Transformation Project, SVTP) promises to transform over 40,000 ha into viable and resilient farmland, yet the valley is endemic for malaria and schistosomiasis and experiences frequent extreme flooding events following tropical cyclones. The latter exacerbate vector-borne disease risk while simultaneously making any empirical assessment of that risk a significant hurdle. We propose that the SVTP provides a unique opportunity to take a One Health approach at mitigating vector-borne disease risk while maintaining agricultural output. A long-term and multi-disciplinary approach with buy-in from multiple stakeholders will be needed to achieve this goal."
432;Strigolactone agonists/antagonists for agricultural applications: New opportunities;"Da-Wei Wang a,**, Zhen Xi a,b";"Strigolactones (SLs) are a new class of phytohormones that not only act as signalling molecules with external rhizospheric fungus and stimulate the seed germination of root parasite weeds, but also regulate many aspects of plant development, such as regulating root and shoot architecture. These intriguing properties, which in turn, make SLs great potency for applications in agriculture. In this review, we highlight the recent advancements in applying SLs and their agonists or antagonists for agricultural applications, including controlling root parasite weeds, improving plant nutrient availability, and regulating abiotic stress responses. Although many SL agonists or antagonists have been synthesized since the first isolation of SL, strigol, in 1966, there is still no commercial application of this class of molecule. We also present an overview of the possible challenges for the practical application of SL agonists or antagonists."
433;Uncovering the dark side of agriculture: How land use intensity shapes soil microbiome and increases potential plant pathogens;"Mohamed Idbella a,b,* , Giuliano Bonanomi a,c";"Soil microbiome plays a critical role in maintaining key soil processes such as litter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant productivity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the variability of soil chemicals, microbial diversity, and composition in seven ecosystems i.e., Fagus sylvatica and Quercus ilex forests, a Mediterranean grassland and shrubland, a vineyard, a horticultural cultivation in open field and under greenhouse, across a gradient of land-use intensity in Southern Italy. Soil chemistry included pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, and C/N ratio, and soil microbiota was characterized by high-throughput sequencing of 16S and ITS genes. Our results showed that greenhouse soils had the highest pH, while Fagus had the lowest. Horticultural, greenhouse, and grassland soils had low levels of OM and total N, while shrubland had relatively high levels of OM, total N, and C/N ratio. Fagus soils, on the other hand, had the highest levels of OM, total N, and C/N ratio. Bacterial diversity was lowest in horticultural soils, whereas fungal diversity was highest in shrubland soils. Pseudomonadota were the predominant bacteria in Fagus, grassland, and vineyard soils, while Actinomycetota dominated in Quercus, shrubland, and greenhouse soils. However, Cyanobacteria was predominant in horticultural soils. On the other hand, the Ascomycota was predominant in all ecosystems except Quercus soils, where the Basidiomycota was dominant. Our bipartite network analysis revealed that bacteria are often the same in different ecosystems while fungi tend to be specific to a particular habitat. Moreover, in agricultural ecosystems, fungal pathogens belonging to Alternaria, Fusarium, Gibellulopsis, Stemphylium, Acremonium, and Curvularia are more abundant, especially in greenhouse. The findings of this study provide important insights into the variability of soil microbial diversity and community composition in different ecosystems, highlighting the essential role of preserving natural ecosystems while managing agricultural ones, given their higher abundance of pathogens."
434;Modeling of dual-permeability gas and solute reactive transport in macroporous agricultural soils with a focus on GHG cycling and emissions;"Mengqi Jia a,b,* , David R. Lapen c , Danyang Su a , K. Ulrich Mayer a";"Agricultural soil is the domain where biogeochemical C-N turnover is affected by atmospheric and hydrologic processes, playing a vital role in anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus affecting global climate change. GHG cycling and emissions are further complicated by the characteristics of soil structure, in particular macropores (i.e., preferential flow pathway). In this study, the processes of non-equilibrium gas diffusion and gas exchange were implemented into an existing dual-permeability flow and reactive solute transport model. The model was then used in a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the suitability of the modeling approach to account for development of anaerobic hotspots, with an emphasis on assessing N2O production and emissions. The sensitivity analysis combined with characteristic time scale analysis suggests that the development of anaerobic hotspots is controlled by a combination of both physical and geochemical parameters. Time scale analysis of O2 supply and consumption indicates that the occurrence of anaerobic hotspots is determined by the balance between characteristic times of O2 diffusion through the soil profile or exchange between macropores and the soil matrix, and the characteristic time of O2 consumption. Motivated by these findings, the present model was applied to simulate GHG cycling at a field site in Ontario, Canada, featuring macroporous agricultural soil. The model generally reproduced observed spatiotemporal variations in pore gas O2 and GHG concentrations and fluxes. Simulation results suggest that at this site, gas exchange processes between regions of preferential flow and the soil matrix play an important role in controlling the spatial variation of O2 in the soil. The simulations illustrate how the release of GHGs from the soil matrix into the macropores can lead to GHG emissions to the atmosphere. The modeling approach presented here, including dual domain flow and solute transport, as well as dual domain gas transport, shows promise for future studies with the aim to develop a more complete understanding of how soil structure affects complex GHG cycling in agricultural soils."
435;Climate forcing datasets for agricultural modeling: Merged products for gap-filling and historical climate series estimation;"Alex C. Ruanea,*, Richard Goldberg b, James Chryssanthacopoulos b";"The AgMERRA and AgCFSR climate forcing datasets provide daily, high-resolution, continuous, meteorological series over the 1980?2010 period designed for applications examining the agricultural impacts of climate variability and climate change. These datasets combine daily resolution data from retrospective analyses (the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, MERRA, and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, CFSR) with in situ and remotely-sensed observational datasets for temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation, leading to substantial reductions in bias in comparison to a network of 2324 agricultural-region stations from the Hadley Integrated Surface Dataset (HadISD). Results compare favorably against the original reanalyses as well as the leading climate forcing datasets (Princeton, WFD, WFD-EI, and GRASP), and AgMERRA distinguishes itself with substantially improved representation of daily precipitation distributions and extreme events owing to its use ofthe MERRA-Land dataset. These datasets also peg relative humidity to the maximum temperature time of day, allowing for more accurate representation of the diurnal cycle of near-surface moisture in agricultural models. AgMERRA and AgCFSR enable a number of ongoing investigations in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) and related research networks, and may be used to fill gaps in historical observations as well as a basis for the generation of future climate scenarios."
436;Intensifying the soil ecological functions for sustainable agriculture: Acting with stakeholders;"Jean Trap * , Eric Blanchart";"Soils are now recognized as key components in the design of sustainable agricultural practices within the agroecological framework. They are the place of many ecological functions achieved by living organisms interacting with each other and which support the sustainable provision of agrosystem services. In the context of the transformation of agriculture and to improve the sustainability and resilience of family farming, it becomes urgent to promote soil ecological functions, to intensify them by appropriate practices considering the socioeconomic constraints, and finally, to be able to monitor them. Here, to improve our consideration of the soil functions for a sustainable agriculture, we first rely on the ecological theories of terrestrial ecosystem functioning to better establish the concept of sustainable functions in agroecosystems. We then propose a methodological framework, called SE-CURE (for ?Soil Ecology Cure?), that aims to optimize the ecological functions of the soil for a sustainable supply of ecosystem services. This framework relies on the involvement of stakeholders and is illustrated by a case study in Madagascar where the different steps of the SE-CURE approach have been applied."

Ruiz Pulpon? e , Oscar ? Jerez Garc? e";"OBJECTIVE: This study?s goals are to identify broad-scale types of agricultural landscapes in Spain that are associated with intensification/disintensification and urbanization and then to use case studies to assess the types and extent of cross-landscape connectivity. It examines the social-ecological connectivity of environmental resources, resource users, and governance. The overarching purpose is to improve the understanding of socialecological connectivity in strengthening the sustainability-enhancing resilience of agricultural landscapes amid global agri-food changes. METHODS: To pursue these goals, we conducted a structured literature review of publications to identify major types of agricultural landscapes in Spain that reflect intensification/disintensification and urbanization trends. Case studies of agricultural landscapes and connectivity were undertaken in the Madrid and Granada regions. These case studies used a structured interview with experienced professional experts in fields of social-ecological sustainability and agricultural landscapes in each region. Analyses including Latent Block Modelling were applied to interview results on types and extent of cross-landscape connectivity in both conventional and alternative agriculture. RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS: The structured literature review identified the predominance of three types of broad-scale agricultural landscapes in Spain: intensive, ?traditional? rural, and peri-urban/urban. Analysis of case-study results revealed variation of the extent and structure of connectivity among clusters of landscape interactions and social-ecological factors. Landscape-level connectivity created both negative agricultural impacts (e.g., extensive water transfers and nutrient pollution in conventional agriculture) and positive impacts (e. g., knowledge system and seed exchanges in alternative agriculture). Interactions of alternative agricultural systems in peri-urban/urban and ?traditional? rural landscapes have benefitted from cross-landscape connectivity amid accelerated agricultural change. SIGNIFICANCE: Research and policy on the landscape-level connectivity of agricultural systems are needed to strengthen sustainability-enhancing resilience of both conventional and alternative agriculture. This study?s approach and results are a strategic complement to existing emphasis on within-landscape cycles of socialecological factors in alternative agriculture. This study?s insights are important in the transition phases of alternative agriculture and associated food systems amid changes due to agricultural intensification/disintensification and urbanization. Understanding selective cross-landscape connectivity is important for spatial approaches to strengthen the sustainability-enhancing resilience of agricultural systems."
438;Wetland nitrogen removal from agricultural runoff in a changing climate;"Josefin E. Nilsson a,b,? , Stefan E.B. Weisner a , Antonia Liess a";"Wetlands in agricultural areas mitigate eutrophication by intercepting nutrient transports from land to sea. The role of wetlands for nutrient removal may become even more important in the future because of the expected increase in agricultural runoff due to climate change. Because denitrification is temperature dependent, wetland nitrogen (N) removal usually peaks during the warm summer. However, climate change scenarios for the northern temperate zone predict decreased summer and increased winter flows. Future wetlands may therefore shift towards lower hydraulic loading rate and N load during summer. We hypothesised that low summer N loads would decrease annual wetland N removal and tested this by examining 1.5?3 years of continuous N removal data from created agricultural wetlands in two regions in southern Sweden (East and West) during different periods. West wetlands showed relatively stable hydraulic loads throughout the year, whereas East wetlands had pronounced no-flow periods during summer. We compared East and West wetlands and tested the effects of several variables (e.g., N concentration, N load, hydraulic load, depth, vegetation cover, hydraulic shape) on annual absolute and relative N removal. We found no difference in annual N removal between East and West wetlands, even though summer N loads were lower in East than in West wetlands. A possible explanation is that stagnant water conditions in East wetlands suppressed decomposition of organic matter during summer, making more organic matter available for denitrification during winter. Absolute N removal in all wetlands was best explained by N load and hydraulic shape, whereas relative N removal was best explained by emergent vegetation cover and hydraulic shape. This study highlights the importance of design and location of agricultural wetlands for high N removal, and we conclude that wetlands in a future climate may remove N from agricultural runoff as efficiently as today"
439;Sustainable management of agricultural water rights trading under uncertainty: An optimization-evaluation framework;"Xianghui Xu c,1 , Yingshan Chen a,1 , Yan Zhou a,* , Wuyuan Liu a , Xinrui Zhang c , Mo Li a,b";"The optimal allocation of agricultural water rights is of great importance in promoting the efficient management of water resources in irrigation areas. In the process of agricultural water rights allocation, problems develop when the dynamics and uncertainties caused by changes in water cycle elements are ignored. To balance socioeconomic development and environmental protection, this study develops a model framework for evaluating and optimizing the synergistic management of agricultural water rights allocation trading under multiple uncertainties (AWRAS-TCME). The model is capable of reflecting the dynamic changes in meteorological and hydrological factors such as rainfall, evapotranspiration and runoff and quantitatively measures the synergistic effect of multidimensional objectives of the economy-society-resources-environment on water rights allocations and transactions. The AWRAS-TCME model integrates a two-level multiobjective nonlinear programming model and a projection tracking model into a framework to measure the fairness and economic benefits of water rights allocation based on an analysis of the sustainability of water rights prices in multiple dimensions, fully considering the influence of uncertainties in hydrological and social systems. The model was applied to an actual irrigation area, and the results showed that (1) total optimized water rights allocation was reduced by 4.7?20.9% at different levels of water supply and demand (2) the total volume of water rights transfer among regions was increased by 4.8%- 12.9%, and the trading volume of the water rights market was increased to account for 5%- 16.2% of the total revenue and (3) the optimal net income of water rights allocation was increased by 1.2%- 3.3%, and the equity of water rights allocation was increased by 0.06?0.09. The developed model promotes the sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources in irrigated areas."
440;Dynamic change of agricultural energy efficiency and its influencing factors in China;"Haipeng Lia*, Li Luoa , Xiong Zhanga , Junbiao Zhangb";"In order to practice the concept of ?lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets? and promote the green development of agriculture, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of agricultural energy utilization. Based on the panel data of 28 provinces from 1995 to 2018, this paper calculated China?s agricultural energy input from two categories of direct energy and indirect energy, and used EBM (Epsilon-based Measure) mixed distance function model to measure the energy efficiency of agriculture in China. The nuclear density function and spatial autocorrelation were used to analyze the dynamic evolution of agricultural energy efficiency, and the dynamic panel model was used to analyze the influencing factors of agricultural energy efficiency. The re- sults showed that: ? From 1995 to 2018, the total agricultural energy input had increased year by year in China, with an average annual growth rate of 2% . Energy input structure changed from indirect energy-based to direct energy-based. Agricultural energy efficiency showed an evolutionary trend of ?rising-stagnatingrising rapidly?in China. The agricultural energy efficiency was generally low in China, and there was a large space for improvement in agricultural energy efficiency. ? From 1995 to 2018, the average annual growth rate of agricultural energy efficiency in the eastern, central and western regions was 2. 7% , 1. 9% and 1. 4% respectively. In 2018, the agricultural energy efficiency in the eastern, central and western regions was 0. 81, 0. 71 and 0. 59 respectively. The gap between regions was expanding rapidly, and the agricultural energy effi- ciency in the central and western regions needed to be improved. ? From 1995 to 2018, the agricultural en- ergy efficiency of each province was polarized and the absolute gap was widened. There was obvious improve- ment in agricultural energy efficiency in Guangdong, Shandong, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Tianjin, while the agricultural energy efficiency of Xinjiang, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Inner Mongolia deteriorated. ? From 1995 to 2018, there was no global spatial correlation of China?s agricultural energy efficiency. How- ever, local ?high-high? concentration gradually appeared in the eastern region since 2010. ? The first lag of energy efficiency had a significant positive impact on agricultural energy efficiency, and agricultural energy ef- ficiency improvement had a time lag. The level of human capital, per capita net income of farmers and the level of urbanizaton had a significant positive impact on agricultural energy efficiency. The disaster rate, the level of development of secondary and tertiary industries, and the level of opening up had a significant nega- tive impact on agricultural energy efficiency. In the implementation of the strategy of rural revitalization, we should focus on the central and western regions, take the cultivation of professional farmers as the key, focus on improving agricultural production conditions, enhance the level of cooperation between regions, exert the leading role of the secondary and tertiary industries, and enhance the ability of agricultural disaster preven- tion and mitigation."
441;The use of combined soil moisture data to characterize agricultural drought conditions and the relationship among different drought types in China;"Keke Zhou a , Jianzhu Li a, *, Ting Zhang a , Aiqing Kang b";"Drought monitoring and assessment are of great importance due to the costly damage caused by drought. Datasets, drought indexes and drought relationships are three critical areas of drought research. Satelliteretrieved soil moisture (SM) products derived from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) show application potential in drought monitoring. However, the products are missing certain data in some areas. The model-assimilated SM product derived from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) was used to supplement these missing data. The main goals of this paper are to characterize agricultural drought after the utility and applicability of the combined SM product and the monthly scaled soil water deficit index (SWDI) have been evaluated and to investigate the relationships among meteorological, agricultural and vegetation droughts. First, we provided a long series of highly accurate SM products through simple calculations. The drought index, SWDI, was extended to a monthly scale for long-term drought analysis by using the combined SM product. The probability of detection (POD) between the SWDI and in situ drought records performed fairly well. Half of the 566 stations had PODs higher than 0.9, and one-third of these stations had POD values equal to 1. Through correlation analysis and grey incidence analysis (GIA) between the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and SWDI, we found that the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought was shorter under drier conditions than wetter conditions, and at the regional scale, the response time ranged from 1 month to 2.5 months. Correlation analysis between the SWDI and vegetation condition index (VCI) indicated that there was no delay effect from agricultural to vegetation drought on a monthly scale in most parts of China except in several provinces distributed in the South additionally, there was a significant time lag in forests, while grassland and agriculture were more inclined to have no time lag or the response time was less than 1 month."
442;Plant-protein-enabled biodegradable triboelectric nanogenerator for sustainable agriculture;"Chengmei Jianga , Qi Zhanga , Chengxin He b , Chi Zhanga , Xiaohui Fengc , Xunjia Li a , Qiang Zhao b , Yibin Yinga , Jianfeng Pinga";"As the use of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) increases, the generation of related electronic waste has been a major challenge. Therefore, the development of environmentally friendly, biodegradable, and low-cost TENGs must be prioritized. Having discovered that plant proteins, by-products of grain processing, possess excellent triboelectric properties, we explore these properties by evaluating the protein structure. The proteins are recycled to fabricate triboelectric layers, and the triboelectric series according to electrical properties is determined for the first time. Using a special structure design, we construct a plant-protein-enabled biodegradable TENG by integrating a polylactic acid film, which is used as a new type of mulch film to construct a growth-promoting system that generates space electric fields for agriculture. Thus, from the plant protein to the crop, a sustainable recycling loop is implemented. Using bean seedlings as a model to confirm the feasibility of the mulch film, we further use it in the cultivation of greenhouse vegetables. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed plant-protein-enabled biodegradable TENG in sustainable agriculture."
443;Environmental effect of agriculture-related manufactured nano-objects on soil microbial communities;"Ayesha Ahmed, Pengfei He, Pengbo He, Yixin Wu, Yueqiu He * , Shahzad Munir *";"Agriculture-related manufactured nano-objects (MNOs) can revolutionize the crop production and help to achieve sustainable development goals. MNOs with diverse physico-chemical properties and ability to encapsulate and deliver active ingredients in controlled, targeted and stimuli responsive manner can enhance the efficiency while minimizing collateral damage to non-target organisms and environment. Application of MNOs in the form of nanopesticides and nanofertilizers is known to affect soil microbial communities both positively and negatively, but detailed studies with varying dose, type and environmental conditions are scarce. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the complex mechanisms and factors which shape the MNOs-microbial interactions through integrating state of the art technologies including omics (transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics), artificial intelligence, and statistical frameworks. Lastly, we propose the idea of MNOs-mediated manipulation of soil microbiome to modify the soil microbial communities for improved microbial services. These microbial services, if harnessed appropriately, can revolutionize modern agriculture and help in achieving sustainable development goals."
444;"Interpretation of uniaxial, confined compression test data for agricultural topsoils";Per Schj?ning;"Traditionally, soil strength is estimated from uniaxial, confined compression tests by procedures adopted from classical soil mechanics. The heterogeneity of agricultural topsoil calls for an alternative approach. Undisturbed soil cores were collected in the plough layer of 14 soils in arable agriculture. Soil texture ranged from coarse sandy to silty loam soils with a maximum of 20% clay. The samples were drained to either of six matric potentials in the range from - 30 to - 300 hPa. Uniaxial, confined compression was applied to ~800 kPa with straincontrolled stress application (1 mm min- 1 ). Measured strain was fitted to stress by the Morgan-Mercer-Flodin (MMF) model. The model fitted data remarkably well for all samples. Three fitting parameters of the model reflected physical characteristics of soil reaction to stress. The estimates of soil compressibility calculated from the model at 10 kPa (C10) correlated closely and linearly to the Cs index considered to reflect elastic deformation in classical studies of soil compression tests. Soil bulk density and content of soil organic matter decreased C10 as well as compressibility at 100 (C100) and 400 kPa (C400). A complex pattern in the effects of soil texture and soil moisture on compressibility was revealed. The pattern in strain-stress data is interpreted as a reflection of a gradual transition from elastic to plastic deformation of the mixture of structural units. The MMF model is suggested for interpretation of strain-stress data from uniaxial, confined compression tests. This implies use of stress in a linear scale."
445;Target Costing as an Approach to reduce Costs in closed-loop Agriculture Systems - Application for the Cultivation of Algae in Photobioreactors;"Maximilian Stangea *, Marc Tiedinga , Gordon Brinitzerb , Steffen Ihlenfeldt a,c*";"The rapidly growing world population, the consequences of climate change and conventional agriculture as well as the limited resources of our planet threaten the food supply of humanity, especially with vital proteins. Therefore, innovation of agricultural systems is crucial for global food security and sustainable development. One proposed system is the cultivation of algae in artificially illuminated photobioreactors, which is a promising technology to limit land and water use. To achieve a competitive position between other agricultural systems and to reduce costs in a systematic and proactive approach, we suggest using Target Costing (TC) at an early stage of development. The paper aims to provide an overview of the state of the art in TC of agricultural systems. The authors identify a suitable approach for the economic evaluation of algae cultivation in bioreactors and adapt it specifically for the extraction of proteins. Based on this, different scenarios are discussed how a cost reduction of the existing systems can be achieved. The focus is on the reduction of energy costs, a suitable site selection and the use of side streams and products."
446;Analyzing the impact of agricultural BMPs on stream nutrient load and biotic health in the Susquehanna-Chemung basin of New York;"Zi Xun Kua a , Cassandra M. Davis b , Lauren A. Townley b , John C. Stella a , Stephen B. Shaw c,";"Despite the widespread use of agricultural best management practices (BMPs) to reduce watershed scale nutrient loads, there remain few studies that use directly observed data ? instead of models ? to evaluate BMP effectiveness at the watershed scale. In this study, we make use of extensive ambient water quality data, stream biotic health data, and BMP implementation data within the New York State portion of the Chesapeake Bay watershed to assess the role of BMPs on reducing nutrient loads and modifying biotic health in major rivers. The specific BMPs considered were riparian buffers and nutrient management planning. A simple mass balance approach was used to evaluate the role of wastewater treatment plant nutrient reductions, agricultural land use changes, and these two agricultural BMPs in matching observed downward trends in nutrient load. In the Eastern nontidal network (NTN) catchment ? where BMPs have been more widely reported ? the mass balance model suggested a small but discernible contribution of BMPs in matching the observed downward trend in total phosphorus. Contrastingly, BMP implementations did not show clear contributions towards total nitrogen reductions in the Eastern NTN catchment nor for the total nitrogen and phosphorus in the Western NTN catchment, where BMP implementation data are more limited. Assessment of the relationship between stream biotic health and BMP implementation using regression models found limited connection between extent of BMP implementation and biotic health. In this case, however, spatiotemporal mismatches between the datasets and the relatively stable biotic health, typically of moderate to good quality even before BMP implementation, may reflect the need for better monitoring design to assess BMP effects at the subwatershed scale. Additional studies, perhaps using citizen scientists, may be able to provide more suitable data within the existing frameworks of the long-term surveys. Given the preponderance of studies that rely only on modeling to understand nutrient loading reductions achieved by implementation of BMPs, it is essential to continue to collect empirical data to meaningfully evaluate whether there are actual measurable changes due to BMPs."
447;"Geopolitical risk on energy, agriculture, livestock, precious and industrial metals: New insights from a Markov Switching model";"Ilyes Abid a,* , Abderrazak Dhaoui b,c , Olfa Kaabia d , Salma Tarchella e";"This paper delineates a novel approach to analyze the dynamic effects of a Geopolitical Risk (GPR) shock on five types of commodities (energy, precious metals, agriculture, industrial metals, and livestock products). Covering a period of 10 years, from 2013 to 2023, we use a Markov-Switching model with two regimes (low and high volatility). The findings indicate that a Markov-Switching model with a t-distribution for the errors is the most suitable to analyze the impact of GPR shocks on commodity markets. All commodities react to a GPR shock but differently. The energy market is the most reactive market and livestock is the less sensitive one. Our results suggest that investors may want to consider the impact of geopolitical risk on different types of commodities before making investment decisions. Market participants should pay attention to changes in the Geopolitical Risk Index during high volatility regimes to better understand the behavior of commodity markets."
448;Forecasting soybean production to enhance climate services for Agriculture in Argentina;"Esteban Otto Thomasz a,* , Kevin Corfield b , Ana Silvia Vilker c , Marisol Osman d,e,f";"Soybean is the most important agricultural commodity produced and exported by Argentina. Water is the most important input for soybean production. Water deficit during critical period and water excess during harvest affect output. Even though it is known that droughts generate important economic losses in soybean production, a standardize model that provides sensibility analysis to explain at what extent water affects output remains a challenge. Therefore, the relation between precipitation levels, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and soil water content was explored, being the soil water content the index with the better performance. By means of a correlation and regression analysis, it was found that in the major number of cases soil water content explains at least 50% percent of the variability in soybean yields, with a maximum of 70% explanatory power in one county. Also, forecast capacity was tested through leave one out validation technique, showing that models are robust enough to provide a one period forecast, as error is mostly explained by the standard deviation of the yield index. The main applications of this finding are related to impact evaluation before final harvesting and the design of index-based insurance."
449;Urban agriculture and policy: Mitigating urban negative externalities;"V.D. Nirusha Ayoni a,1 , Nurul Nadia Ramli a,2,* , Mad Nasir Shamsudin a,3 , Ahmad Hanis Izani Abdul Hadi a,4";"Agriculture and urban agglomerations can be combined in different perspectives, including building-integrated food production. Indeed, urban agriculture is less concerned with helping urban communities achieve food selfsufficiency and more concerned with strengthening urban inhabitants differently. Different signifies multifunctional forms of access to fresh and nutritious vegetables, food bill reduction, personal well-being, and userfriendly agriculture from socioeconomic perspectives. The study estimated willingness to pay and the value of socioeconomic benefits of urban agriculture practices. A choice experiment was performed in Colombo, Sri Lanka?s most urbanized district in 2020. The data were estimated using the random parameter logit model. Positive and significant contributions to urban agriculture related to the utility of urban agriculture practitioners and non-practitioners were evident. The socioeconomic value of urban agriculture benefits generated is equivalent to USD 136,400 per community practices urban agriculture. Urban agriculture thus reveals its vitality as a tool for mitigating the negative impacts of urbanization. The research advocates Colombo municipality to actively encourage urban agriculture by including it in their planning policies."
450;A systematic review on hyperspectral imaging technology with a machine and deep learning methodology for agricultural applications;"Atiya Khan a,c , Amol D. Vibhute b , Shankar Mali a , C.H. Patil a,";"The globes population is increasing day by day, which causes the severe problem of organic food for everyone. Farmers are becoming progressively conscious of the need to control numerous essential factors such as crop health, water or fertilizer use, and harmful diseases in the field. However, it is challenging to monitor agricultural activities. Therefore, precision agriculture is an important decision support system for food production and decision-making. Several methods and approaches have been used to support precision agricultural practices. The present study performs a systematic literature review on hyperspectral imaging technology and the most advanced deep learning and machine learning algorithm used in agriculture applications to extract and synthesize the significant datasets and algorithms. We reviewed legal studies carefully, highlighted hyperspectral datasets, focused on the most methods used for hyperspectral applications in agricultural sectors, and gained insight into the critical problems and challenges in the hyperspectral data processing. According to our study, it has been found that the Hyperion hyperspectral, Landsat-8, and Sentinel 2 multispectral datasets were mainly used for agricultural applications. The most applied machine learning method was support vector machine and random forest. In addition, the deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model is mainly used for crop classification due to its high performance with hyperspectral datasets. The present review will be helpful to the new researchers working in the field of hyperspectral remote sensing for agricultural applications with a machine and deep learning methods."
451;Concepts of agricultural marginal lands and their utilisation: A review;"Nandor ? Csikos? a,* , Gergely Toth ? a,b";"CONTEXT: The potential of marginal lands to improve food security, support bioenergy production or ecosystem services has globally got a lot of attention. Defining agricultural marginal land is a task that involves more than just considering the land?s quality, its definition changed a lot during the last two centuries. OBJECTIVE: Development of new technologies and policy trends require the concepts of prime land and marginal land to be renewed from time to time. Although much research has been done on the concept of marginal land, it is currently limited by the lack of a clear, globally accepted definition. METHOD: There are four major sources of criteria of marginal lands: economic (e.g., rent cost, land value), geographical (e.g., temperature, slope, precipitation), ecosystem-based (e.g., protected areas, recreation, ecosystem services), soil suitability (e.g., yield capability, physical and chemical soil properties). The categorisation of agricultural land into groups like productive, marginal or unproductive often depends on the cultivation or management type. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Since conceptions of marginal land are dynamic both in time and space, flexible policy and practical solutions are needed for their non-degrading use, which in any case shall support naturebased socioeconomic development. To maintain the socioeconomic value of these areas, it is crucial to develop rural areas that are economically or biophysically marginalised. High nature value farming, bioenergy crops by sustainable land management and afforestation are highly recommended. Choosing the right management can transform marginal land into an optimal soil condition or incorrect management can degrade prime land into marginal land (unproductive land). SIGNIFICANCE: This paper provides a review and categorisation of the historical and new developments of marginal land concepts especially those which are working with agricultural aspects, including land management and reclamation. It could give a strong basis for further research in topic of marginal land."
452;Agricultural activities lead to sediment infilling of wetlandscapes in the Canadian Prairies: Assessment of soil erosion and sedimentation fluxes;"Ehsan Zarrinabadi a,* , David A. Lobb a , Eric Enanga a , Pascal Badiou b , Irena F. Creed c";"Wetlandscapes are vulnerable to land conversion and sediment infilling from upland agriculture, causing them to act as sinks for sediment deposition and putting at risk their ecosystem services. Wetlandscapes in the Canadian Prairies agroecosystems are particularly susceptible to sediment infilling because of the intensification of human activities and agricultural practices. The rising risk of soil erosion in cultivated landscapes has generated a need to estimate soil redistribution rates and soil loss monitoring tools and techniques. This research examines the effects of agricultural activities on soil loss and sedimentation rates within agricultural landscapes in the Canadian Prairies. Land and atmospheric fluxes of sediment into wetlands are quantified over the past 60 years using catchment-scale tracing ( 137Cs) and budgeting techniques. Findings indicate that the pattern of 137Cs erosion/deposition varies along catchment toposequences, with erosion near the top of the toposequences (the average annual soil erosion rates were found to be 1.1 kg m- 2 yr- 1 for Manitoba and 0.3 kg m- 2 yr- 1 for Alberta) and deposition within the wetland ecosystem (total deposition rates were estimated at about - 3.6 kg m- 2 yr-1for Manitoba and - 0.9 kg m- 2 yr- 1 for Alberta). The sediment delivery ratios were approximately 57% and 35% in Manitoba and Alberta, respectively, indicating that a noticeable amount of the mobilized sediment exits the field. These transfers from cultivated fields into wetlands reveal that wetlandscapes in Canadian Prairies are vulnerable to sediment infilling, and soil erosion control practices are needed to achieve sustainable management of agricultural landscapes."
453;Evapotranspiration and carbon exchange of the main agroecosystems and their responses to agricultural land use change in North China Plain;"Yucui Zhang a , Xiaonan Guo b , Hongwei Pei c , Leilei Min a , Fan Liu a , Yanjun Shen a,d";"The North China Plain (NCP) plays an important role in food production while there is serious groundwater overexploitation in this area. The quantified relationship between the variation in evapotranspiration (ET) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and agricultural land use change in NCP remains unclear. In this study, based on the eddy covariance method, water balance method, and remote sensing data, ET and NEE variations were quantified and the impacts of agricultural land use change from 2002 to 2012 on regional ET and NEE variation were analyzed. The average ET and NEE of the winter wheat ? summer maize cropland ecosystem were 714.2 mm yr-1 and - 534.3 gC m-2 yr-1, respectively. Correspondingly, the above values were 786.2 mm yr-1 and 667.5 gC m-2 yr-1 for the pear orchard ecosystem, and 778.6 mm yr-1 and 814.8 gC m-2 yr-1 for the vegetable field ecosystem, which had relatively high ET and ecosystem productivity. The average annual ET and NEE of the cotton field ecosystem were only 592.0 mm and - 351.3 gC m-2, respectively. Agricultural land area increased by 331.2 ? 103 ha over 2002?2012, which was caused by the increasing land area of spring maize, forest/fruit trees, and vegetables. As a result, the ET and NEE of the agroecosystems in NCP increased by 25.6 ? 108 m3 and - 257.9 ? 104 tonC from 2002 to 2012, which are beneficial for carbon sequestration. However, the increase in carbon sink was at the cost of greater groundwater overexploitation due to increased regional water consumption. The planting of crops with high water consumption should be reduced as the surpluses of these agricultural products compared to the food demand in this region. These results are meaningful for reasonable planting structure adjustment of water-adaptive sustainable agricultural development in the NCP."
454;Understanding technology acceptance in smart agriculture: A systematic review of empirical research in crop production;"Rosemary J. Thomas, Gregory OHare, David Coyle *";"Smart agriculture offers the potential to analyse agricultural data at a scale not previously possible. Researchers argue that the combination of rich data and intelligent decision support has the potential to improve productivity and profitability in agriculture, whilst also improving sustainability. We argue that achieving this potential requires not just on technological advancement, it also requires a detailed understanding of factors that impact technology acceptance in smart agriculture. Acceptance is necessary if technical advances are to translate into real-world impact. However, technology acceptance is complex and often poorly understood. This systematic review focuses on technology acceptance in prediction and decision support systems in crop production. Major databases were searched to identify papers that formally address technology acceptance and include detailed data. 16 papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Common facilitators and barriers are identified, and papers are mapping against the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. This analysis showed that constructs including perceived effectiveness are addressed frequently, but others such as opportunity costs and burden have received less attention. The findings suggest the necessity for greater application of formal methods and the need for standardized, domain-specific methods to support this assessment."
455;Agricultural development in the presence of foreign divestment: Policy options;"Justice G. Djokoto * , Ferguson Korbla Gidiglo, Francis Yao Srofenyoh, Kofi Aaron A-O Agyei-Henaku, Charlotte Badu Prah, Akua Agyeiwaa Afrane Arthur";"Following the implications of the loss of employment, revenue, foreign exchange, and the negative impact on overall agricultural development resulting from foreign divestment, estimates of the extent of foreign divestment on agricultural development and policy options for ameliorating this effect were obtained. A cross-sectional data of 159 observations was fitted to a derived model and estimated by OLS. One US$ increase in foreign divestment reduces agricultural development by US$ 0.04. Policy mixes involving the combination of domestic investment, aid, and trade in response to foreign divestment in agriculture have been proposed. The best policy mix is the combination of domestic investment, aid, and trade to respond to foreign divestment in agriculture. Aid to agriculture independently was ineffective in promoting agricultural development, however, other variables produced a synergistic effect. Despite efforts to attract foreign direct investment in agriculture, foreign divestment does occur with the associated disbenefits to the sector which is detrimental to agricultural development. It is important to identify the policy options to address this in the study."
456;A time series model adapted to multiple environments for recirculating aquaculture systems;"Gedi Liu a,b,c,d,1 , Yifeng Jiang a,b,c,d,1 , Keyang Zhong a,b,c,d , Yan Yang e , Yang Wang a,b,c,d,";"Summary: Environmental time series modeling of recirculating aquaculture systems provides the basis for the design of intelligent and foreseeable agricultural facilities. The modeling accuracy of environmental factors plays an important role, which could help grasp the environmental situation and change trend of the recirculating aquaculture system, assist in early warning when the environment factor level exceeds the normal data range, and combine with the control method to improve the accuracy of environmental control. The traditional time series model is difficult to predict complex situations, which is mainly due to the effective integration of multidimensional data. Our goal is to make improvements to the traditional time series model. The proposed multiple graph fusion network (GraphTS) fuses multi-sensor Spatio-temporal information using a multi-graph fusion method based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and graph attention neural network. We collected two recirculating aquaculture datasets with various features and applications to test GraphTS?s performance. Comparing the average metrics of predictor outcomes of proposed GraphTS with the standard model LSTM, the average margin of error (AME) is reduced by 37% and 13%, and the Pearson correlation Coefficient (PCC) is improved to 97% and 96% for two datasets, respectively. The best results are also achieved on the discrete traffic prediction dataset. It shows the adaptability and multi-dimensional information gathering ability of GraphTS."
457;Agricultural composition and labor productivity;"Cesar Blanco a,1 , Xavier Raurich b,*,1";"Labor productivity differences between developing and developed countries are much larger in agriculture than in non-agriculture. We show that differences in agricultural composition across countries explain a substantial part of these labor productivity differences. To this end, we group agricultural products into two sectors: capital-intensive and labor-intensive agriculture. As the economy develops and capital accumulates, the price of labor-intensive agricultural goods relative to capital-intensive agricultural goods increases. This price change drives a process of structural change that moves land and farmers to the capital-intensive sector, increasing labor productivity in agriculture. We illustrate this mechanism using a multisector growth model that generates transitional dynamics consistent with patterns of structural change observed in Brazil and also differences in agricultural composition and labor productivity consistent with cross-country data."
458;Net export of E. coli from a constructed wetland treating agricultural drainage;"Rebecca Stott * , James P.S. Sukias, Lucy A. McKergow , Robert J. Davies-Colley , Chris C. Tanner";"Monitoring of a constructed wetland receiving episodic pulses of subsurface drainage waters from grazed dairy pastures showed good nitrogen reductions, but moderate increases in median Escherichia coli concentrations. This unexpected increase of E. coli was initially postulated to be an artefact of the routine sampling approach, which was biased towards receding flows and likely missed high inflows of contaminated drainage. Intensive monitoring during storm events was therefore instigated using auto-samplers to quantify responses during rainfallgenerated flow events. Determination of inflow and outflow E. coli fluxes and loads for ten storm events concluded that the wetland was consistently a net exporter of E. coli with increases ranging from 1.5 to 26-fold (median 10.2-fold). Whilst wildlife defecation in the wetland may account for a proportion of the rise in E. coli, it is likely that (consistent with associated genetic profiling studies) much of the increase is due to mobilisation of environmentally adapted strains of E. coli persisting and growing within the sediment, decomposing plant litter and organic detritus of the wetland. This raises interesting questions regarding the microbial ecology of E. coli and its utility as an indicator of faecal pathogens, and potential health risks from diffuse agricultural drainage after passage through wetlands."

460;Biodiversity decline with increasing crop productivity in agricultural fields revealed by satellite remote sensing;"Abdulhakim M. Abdi a,1,* , Romain Carri?e a,1 , William Sidemo-Holm a , Zhanzhang Cai b , Niklas Boke-Ol?en a , Henrik G. Smith a,c , Lars Eklundh b , Johan Ekroos a,d";"Increasing land-use intensity is a main driver of biodiversity loss in farmland, but measuring proxies for land-use intensity across entire landscapes is challenging. Here, we develop a novel method for the assessment of the impact of land-use intensity on biodiversity in agricultural landscapes using remote sensing parameters derived from the Sentinel-2 satellites. We link crop phenology and productivity parameters derived from time-series of a two-band enhanced vegetation index with biodiversity indicators (insect pollinators and insect-pollinated vascular plants) in agricultural fields in southern Sweden, with contrasting land management (i.e. conventional and organic farming). Our results show that arable land-use intensity in cereal systems dominated by spring-sown cereals can be approximated using Sentinel-2 productivity parameters. This was shown by the significant positive correlations between the amplitude and maximum value of the enhanced vegetation index on one side and farmer reported yields on the other. We also found that conventional cereal fields had 17% higher maximum and 13% higher amplitude of their enhanced vegetation index than organic fields. Sentinel-2 derived parameters were more strongly correlated with the abundance and species richness of bumblebees and the richness of vascular plants than the abundance and species richness of butterflies. The relationships we found between biodiversity and crop production proxies are consistent with predictions that increasing agricultural land-use intensity decreases field biodiversity. The newly developed method based on crop phenology and productivity parameters derived from Sentinel-2 data serves as a proof of concept for the assessment of the impact of land-use intensity on biodiversity over cereal fields across larger areas. It enables the estimation of arable productivity in cereal systems, which can then be used by ecologists and develop tools for land managers as a proxy for land-use intensity. Coupled with spatially explicit databases on agricultural land-use, this method will enable crop-specific cereal productivity estimation across large geographical regions."
461;Sex-disaggregated agricultural extension and weather variability in Africa south of the Sahara;"Carlo Azzarri a,? , Gianluigi Nico b";"Climate change and extreme weather shocks pose serious threats to a number of agricultural outcomes, including agricultural production, productivity, and income, especially when households depend heavily on this activity. Agricultural extension and rural advisory services are key instruments in promoting technical change, advancing agricultural productivity growth and, ultimately, improving farm livelihoods, and are expected to mitigate the negative effects of climate change and extreme weather shocks. Their mitigation effects, however, may vary depending on the sex of the recipient. This paper investigates the role of sex-disaggregated agricultural extension recipients in contexts where agricultural performance of farm households is affected by weather variability. To this aim, we match multiple rounds of panel microdata from the nationally representative, consumption-based Living Standards Measurement Study -Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA), collected in four sub-Saharan African countries, with remote sensing data on biophysical dimensions over a long-term horizon as well as year-specific weather shocks. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a micro-level dataset with individual-level information on agricultural extension services? recipients has been assembled and examined to investigate the effects of extreme weather shocks and climate change. Applying panel data econometric estimators, the study finds that agricultural extension and advisory services translate into higher agricultural performance of farm households where women are also among the beneficiaries, as compared to non-beneficiaries and households where beneficiaries are men only. Moreover, these services can mitigate the negative effects of weather variability and climate change, controlling for country and time fixed effects as well as holding all other variables constant. These results call for national and international policies and interventions strengthening rural advisory services, especially targeted to women in settings where household livelihoods are predominantly agriculture-based and weather variability and shocks are expected to negatively affect farming activities."

463;Why the low adoption of robotics in the farms? Challenges for the establishment of commercial agricultural robots;"Gustavo Gil a , Daniel Emilio Casagrande b,* , Leonardo P?ez Cort? c , Rodrigo Verschae b";"In a world that requires sustainable agricultural practices, quantitative plant-by-plant and field status monitoring can be advantageous to all farmers by optimizing their farm management. Autonomous robots, sensing technologies, and automated data analysis will play a key role. In the present article, we discuss three critical aspects of the incorporation of field robots in agriculture: 1) the main design specifications and economic aspects for Commercial Agricultural Robots (CARs) in terms of autonomous navigation (perception, localization, and kinematics) 2) the business models of agricultural robotics companies, which are compared to successful business models of robotic companies on the medical field 3) the possibilities that CARs could bring, including the generation of big data about local food production and its impact on the local environment. Our analysis highlights the reasons that explain the low adoption of CARs in the current agricultural market. Finally, we reflect on the current distorted costs that consumers pay for food while the ecological footprints of food production and food delivery are neglected, and we encourage the discussion to promote sustainable food policies that support the establishment of robotic agricultural companies."
464;Addressing diffuse water pollution from agriculture: Do governance structures matter for the nature of measures taken?;"Mark Wiering a,* , Sabrina Kirschke b , Nasir Uddin Akif b,c";"Nutrient pollution of freshwaters from agriculture is a key barrier to achieving the water quality goals of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Governance research suggests that governance structures can support the planning of water quality measures. However, it is widely unclear how specific governance structures affect the actual nature of practical measures taken for addressing the ?wicked problem? of diffuse nutrient pollution. This study analyses how the extent of consensual policy styles, organizational and program integration, participatory governance, and the capacities of public authorities are related to the substance of practical measures taken (effect-vs. source-based measures) and the choice of policy instruments (e.g., sermons, carrots, sticks). Based on a comparative case study design including six country cases, document analyses, and expert interviews, we find no clear-cut relationships between the country?s governance structures and the types of measures chosen or any trend of a combined effect. This suggests that, in the case of the WFD, governance structures are less important than expected or that different governance structures compensate for the effects on the level of practical measures taken and policy instruments chosen. These results question the dominant assumption that these governance structures matter (a lot) in wicked problem solving and may hint to additional context factors these governance structures are embedded in."
465;Biorefining of rapeseed meal: A new and sustainable strategy for improving Cr(VI) biosorption on residual wastes from agricultural byproducts after phenolic extraction;"Pei Liu a,b,1 , Yangmin Gong a,b,1 , Chen Yang a,b , Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro c , Young-Kyoung Park c , Shiyu Deng a,b , Yuliang Wang d , Hongbo Wei e , Wenchao Chen a,b,";"Phenolic recovery from agricultural byproducts has been highlighted due to their health-promoting bioactivities. However, uncontrolled discard of residues after extraction process would induce environmental pollution and bioresource waste. In this study, biorefining of phenolic-rich rapeseed meal (RSM) and its defatted sample (dRSM) was attempted by holistic utilization of phenolic extract and residue separately. Phenolic removal could significantly improve residues? Cr(VI) adsorption capacities by about 21%, which presented extended physical surface and more released functional groups. Moreover, simulating raw material by remixing 3% separated phenolic extracts or main component sinapic acid therein with corresponding residues further improved about 12% adsorption efficiencies. These indicated that the different present forms of phenolics had opposite effects on Cr(VI) removal. While natural conjugational form inhibited hosts? biosorption, free form had enhanced functions for either extract or residue. Four optimal adsorption parameters (pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time and initial Cr(VI) concentration), three kinetic (pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intra-particle diffusion) models and two isotherms (Langmuir and Freundlich) were used to reveal the adsorption process. The maximum Cr(VI) adsorption capacity on residues could reach about 100 mg/g, which was superior to that of most biosorbents derived from agricultural byproducts, even some biochar. Together with the residues? advantages with everlasting capacity after 3 adsorption?desorption cycles and excellent abilities for adsorbing multiple co-existed metal ions (Cr(VI), Cd(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II)), phenolic recovery was first proved to be a new and sustainable strategy for modifying biosorbents from agricultural byproducts with zero waste."
466;"Exposure to agricultural technologies and adoption: The West Africa agricultural productivity program in Ghana, Senegal and Mali";"Yiriyibin Bambio a,* , Anurag Deb b , Harounan Kazianga c";"We estimate the effects of increased exposure to agricultural technologies on farmers? adoption and economic well-being in Ghana, Mali, and Senegal using post-implementation data collected in 2019. The program, known as the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP), aimed at improving agricultural productivity to enhance economic growth, food security and to reduce poverty and ran in two phases. We focus on the second phase of the program, which ran between 2012 and 2019. We use ex-ante matching at the village and household levels to select the estimation sample. We find that the treatment raised technology adoption by 0.32 percentage points and the adoption of improved seeds by 0.20 percentage points. The program also increased productivity and income of the treated households by 10% and 17% respectively, relative to the comparison households. There were no detectable effects on consumption and food security. We provide suggestive evidence indicating that the additional income may have been saved or invested. Taken together, these results suggest that multicountry agricultural programs can be effective at spurring economic transformation."
467;Low agricultural potential exacerbates the effect of temperature on civil conflicts;"Jonathan Goyette * , Maroua Smaoui";"We examine the impact of temperature variations on the incidence of civil state conflicts, focusing on a specific mechanism: the agricultural potential of a country, i.e., its initial agricultural conditions before human interventions. Using data for 172 countries from 1946 until 2014, we conduct a natural experiment and identify the effect of the interaction between time-wise variations in temperature within a country and the cross-country variation in agricultural potential on conflict incidence. We find that there is a significantly higher probability to be in conflict when annual temperature deviates from its mean in a country with low agricultural potential relative to a country with high agricultural potential. An analysis of the long-term relationship (decennial averages) points to an exacerbation of the negative impact of the agricultural potential-temperature interaction on civil conflicts. The findings also suggest that the interaction has similar effects across development levels, no matter the share of agriculture in a country?s GDP, and no significant effect in countries with exportable resources such as oil. The results are robust to a high resolution grid analysis when we use a suitability index for wheat. For other cereals and other specifications, including standardized temperature and long differences, the results are significant when controlling for the distance to the capital. This is the first study to show that initial agricultural conditions play a significant role to understand the climate-conflict linkages on a global scale."
468;"Grassland mowing event detection using combined optical, SAR, and weather time series";"Ann-Kathrin Holtgrave a,c,* , Felix Lobert b,d , Stefan Erasmi b , Norbert R?er a , Birgit Kleinschmit c";"The European Union?s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Habitats Directive aim to improve biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Both policies require enormous monitoring, which can be facilitated by remote sensing. Use intensity, measured by mowing frequency is an important indicator of biodiversity in permanent grasslands. The frequency and timing of mowing can be determined using satellite remote sensing because photosynthetically active biomass changes rapidly in response to mowing. However, the rapid regrowth of grasses requires very dense satellite time series for reliable detection. Radar time series can complement optical time series and fill in cloud-related gaps to overcome this problem. Additional weather data can support the detection of grassland mowing events, as mowing events are associated with specific meteorological conditions. However, previous studies have not fully exploited both potentials or different machine learning approaches for mowing event detection. This study presents a new transferable two-step approach to detect grassland mowing events using combined optical and SAR data and additional weather data. First, we filled cloud-related gaps in optical time series using a supervised machine learning regression with optical and SAR data. We then classified time series sequences of optical, SAR and weather data into mown and unmown using four different machine learning algorithms. We used time series of NDVI and EVI (combined Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8), SAR backscatter, six-day interferometric coherence, backscatter radar vegetation index, backscatter cross-ratio (Sentinel-1), and temperature and precipitation sums. Our test sites are distributed across Germany and cover the entire gradient of grassland use intensities. Mowing events could be detected with F1 values of up to 89%, first cut with up to 94%. Our results show no structural advantage of infilling time series with machine learning over linearly interpolated time series. The combined Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 time series provided dense time series with mostly median gaps less than 20 days, which proved sufficient to reliably detect mowing events. SAR data were not essential for mowing event detection in our study, but weather data improved classification results for models trained on all areas and years. However, when the model was transferred to unknown years or areas that were not used for training, SAR data improved detection accuracy, whereas weather data degrade it. Models trained on all years but not all study sites detected mowing events with an accuracy of up to F1 = 76%. Models trained with all regions but not all years detected mowing events in untrained years with F1 up to 80%."
469;Assessment of meteorological and agricultural droughts using remote sensing and their impact on groundwater in an agriculturally productive part of Northwest India;"Lakhvinder Kaur a,b,*,1,2 , Madhuri S. Rishi b,3,4 , Bhagwan Singh Chaudhary a,2,5";"Wheat is an important component of global food security, and Punjab and Haryana are the major wheat-growing areas in Northwest India, but climate change has increased the frequency of droughts in this region. Timely, precise, and effective drought monitoring is critical to ensure food security. In the present study, meteorological and agricultural droughts were assessed using standard precipitation index (SPI) and remote sensing-based indices, namely vegetation health index (VHI) and normalized vegetation supply water index (NVSWI) during the Rabi season (wheat growing season) in three different agroclimatic zones (ACZs i.e., ACZ I: Hot arid agroclimatic zone, ACZ II: Semi-arid agro-climatic zone, and ACZ III: Hot sub-humid agro-climatic zone) of Punjab and Haryana. Furthermore, correlations between NVSWI, VHI, SPI, and gross primary productivity (GPP) were investigated, as well as trend analysis of NVSWI and groundwater level to better understand their interrelationships and the impact of agricultural droughts on groundwater level. The results of SPI indicated that ACZ III witnessed more drought episodes than ACZ I and II. The driest years in ACZ I, ACZ II, and ACZ III were 2002?03, 2014?15, and 2016?17, respectively, while the year 2018?19 was observed as normal in all the ACZs. A significant high correlation was observed between the NVSWI and VHI and the NVSWI and GPP in all three ACZs, while SPI did not exhibit a significant correlation with the NVSWI in ACZ II and III. The Mann-Kendall Test and Sen?s slope indicated a declining groundwater trend in all the ACZs and an increasing trend in NVSWI values. The results underline the robustness of SPI and NVSWI in drought monitoring in semi-arid and arid zones of northwest India. Rainfall variability and increased groundwater use for irrigation practices in semi-arid and hot sub-humid areas are leading to groundwater decline."

Since grain-croplands are the main occupation within the Brazilian croplands that has played a substantial role in the country?s land use/land cover (LULC) dynamic, this study aims at proposing a grain-cropping suitability index (CroppingSI) to support the geographical analysis of LULC agricultural trends. The proposed approach considers detailed information on climate, soils, and terrain coupled with grain-crop simulations, soil quality indexing, and terrain restrictions evaluated at the highest available resolution. With historical LULC maps (2000 and 2020), we found that terrain was the most critical factor for cropland expansion, followed by climate and soil quality. The new croplands expanded towards regions with better climate and terrain conditions while neglecting the soil quality, mostly in the Cerrado and Amazon regions. In addition, the assessment of CroppingSI was instrumental in understanding that expanding new croplands over current cleared areas (i.e., pasturelands) may expose them to marginal soil and terrain conditions. This suggests a fragility of the current expansion trend of grain-cropping systems which can substantially put food security at risk, requiring alternative strategies for maintaining or improving food through crop intensification."
471;Reducing property taxes for agriculture: Diffusion of use-value assessment policy across the United States;"John E. Anderson a,* , Seth H. Giertz b , Shafiun N. Shimul c";"We analyze the spread across the fifty states of use-value assessment (UVA) programs applied to agricultural and rural land for property tax purposes. Taxing land based on the value associated with its current use in agriculture rather than its full market value can confer substantial tax savings for landowners, affecting land use patterns. Using time-to-event models, we find that the secular trend toward urbanization across all fifty states was a driving force behind the spread of UVA policies. In particular, increasing secular trends in agricultural land values (associated with urbanization) provide a strong motivation for agriculture to pursue UVA, and this factor appears to be the key driver of UVA adoption throughout all of our models. We delve deeper, hoping to understand underlying factors through which UVA is spread across states. We consider the literature on policy diffusion as well as factors suggested by models of collective action, based on concentrated benefits and dispersed costs. Once land values are accounted for, the role of these underlying factors is generally inconclusive. One exception is the relationship between agriculture?s share of state GDP and UVA adoption. Here, a clear negative relationship is found that is, UVA adoption is more rapid in states where agriculture?s share of state GDP is smaller. This result is at odds with traditional voting models where the median voter, likely not an agricultural landowner, would be expected to favor non-adoption of UVA policies."
472;Data reduction based on machine learning algorithms for fog computing in IoT smart agriculture;"Franklin M. Ribeiro Junior a,b,* , Reinaldo A.C. Bianchi c , Ronaldo C. Prati a , Kari Kolehmainen d , Juha-Pekka Soininen d , Carlos A. Kamienski a";"Smart agriculture applications that analyse and manage agricultural yield using IoT systems may suffer from intermittent operation due to cloud disconnections commonly occurring in rural areas. A fog computing solution enables the IoT system to process data faster and deal with intermittent connectivity. However, the fog needs to send a high volume of data to the cloud and this can cause link congestion with unusable data traffic. Here we propose an approach to collect and store data in a fog-based smart agriculture environment and different data reduction methods. Sixteen techniques for data reduction are investigated eight machine learning (ML) methods combined with run-length encoding, and eight combined with Huffman encoding. Our experiment uses two real data sets, where the first contains air temperature and humidity values, and the second has soil moisture and temperature conditions. The fog filters cluster the unlabelled data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms that group data into categories according to their value ranges in all experiments. Supervised learning classification methods are also used to predict the class of data samples from these categories. After that, the fog filter compresses the identified categories using two data compression techniques, run-length encoding (RLE) and the Huffman encoding, preserving the data time series nature. Our results reveal that a k-means combined with RLE method achieved the highest reduction, where the fog needed to store and transmit only 3%e6% of the original data generated by sensors."
473;A comprehensive remote sensing-based Agriculture Drought Condition Indicator (CADCI) using machine learning;"Khaled F. Alkaraki a,c , Khaled Hazaymehb,c,*";"Agriculture drought is a decrease in soil moisture during a growing season. In this study, a comprehensive remote sensing-based Agriculture Drought Condition Indicator (CADCI) was developed to monitor the agriculture drought in semi-arid environments and assess its effectiveness in rainfed agriculture regions in (A) Jordan and (B) Syria. First, remote sensed-based drought-condition spectral indices [i.e., Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Evapotranspiration Condition Index (ETCI), Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI)] were calculated using data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite (MODIS) [Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and evapotranspiration (ET)] the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPMs) the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAPs) and Sentinel-1A. Second, Random Forest (RF) was used to estimate and determine the relative importance of these indices based on Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values to select the three spectral indices that have the most monthly short-term relative importance in identifying the agriculture drought for semi-arid environments, which were PCI, TCI, and VCI. Third, these indices were integrated to identify the drought severity based on specific thresholds that compare the pixel-specific value with the study area average value. For instance, a severe drought condition is identified if all three indices indicate a drought condition, a moderate drought or mild drought conditions are identified if any two or any one of the indices indicate drought conditions, respectively. Lastly, a none drought condition is identified if none of the indices indicate a drought condition. Finally, the SPI sets for 1 and 3-months (SPI-1 and SPI-3) were used to evaluate the performance of the CADCI. The results showed the CADCI has a high agreement with SPI-1 classes in the study areas, with overall accuracy and Kappa-values of 85% and 0.80, for study area A and 83% and 0.76 for study area B, respectively. Consequently, the CADCI shows its ability to monitor agricultural drought in semi-arid environments. Perhaps, it could be applicable for larger areas due to the spatial resolution of the input dataset."

Environmental and socioeconomic factors in South Africas agricultural system have been affected by drought in the past, creating cascading pressures on the nations agro-economic and water supply systems. Therefore, understanding the key drivers of all risk components through a comprehensive risk assessment must be undertaken in order to inform proactive drought risk management. This paper presents, for the first time, a national drought risk assessment for irrigated and rainfed systems, that takes into account the complex interaction between different risk components. We use modeling and remote sensing approaches and involve national experts in selecting vulnerability indicators and providing information on human and natural drivers. Our results show that all municipalities have been affected by drought in the last 30 years. The years 1981?1982, 1992, 2016 and 2018 were marked as the driest years during the study period (1981?2018) compared to the reference period (1986?2015). In general, the irrigated systems are remarkably less often affected by drought than rainfed systems however, most farmers on irrigated land are smallholders for whom drought impacts can be significant. The drought risk of rainfed agricultural systems is exceptionally high in the north,central and west of the country, while for irrigated systems, there are more separate high-risk hotspots across the country. The vulnerability assessment identified potential entry points for disaster risk reduction at the local municipality level, such as increasing environmental awareness, reducing land degradation and increasing total dam and irrigation capacity"
475;The impact of vegetated landscape elements on runoff in a small agricultural watershed: A modelling study;"Ine Rosier * , Jan Diels, Ben Somers, Jos Van Orshoven";"Flooding of settlements is a growing concern in Europe, also in agricultural areas. Restoration and installation of vegetated landscape elements (vLE) such as hedges, lines of trees and grass buffers, along the parcel boundaries is increasingly recognized as a way to mitigate downstream flood risk. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence to support their implementation. We used the Landlab modelling framework to gain knowledge about the importance of the presence and characteristics of vLEs for the hydrological response in a 26 ha undulating watershed representative for the Belgian loess belt for which a multitude of vLE scenarios were developed. Our model results demonstrated that the total runoff volume, the peak discharge rate and its lag time in such small watersheds are mainly controlled by the density of the vLE objects and their upstream area. First and foremost we demonstrated a negative correlation between the discharge volume and peak discharge rate and the density of the vLE objects and their upstream area. A positive correlation was observed between the lag time and density of the vLE objects for both dry and wet soils and between the lag tag time and upstream area for dry soils. Further, we found that the impact of the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil covered by the vLE became increasingly important with increasing soil wetness, with the hydraulic conductivity being negatively correlated with the discharge volume and peak discharge rate. The impact of hydraulic conductivity on the lag time was limited. A negative correlation between hydraulic conductivity and lag time for intermediate wet soils was demonstrated. Our model results also showed that the roughness, expressed as the Manning n-coefficient, of the soil underneath a vLE and the spatial connectivity of the vLE objects have little impact on the hydrological response."
476;A review on the combination of deep learning techniques with proximal hyperspectral images in agriculture;Jayme Garcia Arnal Barbedo;"Hyperspectral images can capture the spectral characteristics of surfaces and objects, providing a 2-D spacial component to the spectral profiles found in a given scene. There are several techniques that can be used to extract information from hyperspectral images, with deep learning becoming the preferred choice in the last decade due to its ability to implicitly extract features from images. The combination of hyperspectral images with deep learning has been extensively explored in the context of remote sensing (data collected by drones and satellites), which has generated an extensive literature that has been thoroughly analyzed in a series of reviews and surveys. The application of deep learning to proximal hyperspectral images is more recent, but there are already many articles dedicated to this objective, especially in the areas of agriculture and food science. Although significant progress has been made in just a few years, there are still many aspects that are not well understood and many problems that have not yet been overcome. This review aims at characterizing the current state of the art of deep learning applied to hyperspectral images captured at close range, focusing on the main challenges and research gaps that still need to be properly addressed. Some possible solutions and potential directions for future research are suggested, as an effort to bring the techniques developed in the academy closer to meeting the requirements found in practice. Only applications related to vegetable production and products were considered in this review, because applications related to animal farming and products of animal origin have their own particularities and the literature on the subject is not as extensive."
477;"Investigation about the correlation and propagation among meteorological, agricultural and groundwater droughts over humid and arid/semi-arid basins in China";"Hao Zhang , Jie Ding , Yushi Wang , Dongyang Zhou , Qian Zhu *";"The propagation of meteorological drought in the hydrological cycle not only leads to the deficits of surface soil moisture, which results in agricultural drought, but also probably affects groundwater to trigger groundwater drought. Improving the understanding about the correlation and propagation among meteorological, agricultural and groundwater droughts is necessary to lessen the risks resulted from them. Moreover, the distinction of the correlation and propagation over the basins with different climate conditions is not yet sufficiently understood. As a case study of the humid and arid/semi-arid basins in China, the standardized precipitation index, the standardized soil moisture index and groundwater drought index based on GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) are used to characterize meteorological, agricultural and groundwater drought respectively over the Yangtze River Basin with a humid climate condition and Yellow River Basin with an arid/semi-arid climate condition. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is applied to investigate the correlation and propagation among the above three types of drought in the two basins. The results indicated that: (1) The meteorological, agricultural and groundwater droughts in the Yangtze River Basin and the meteorological and agricultural droughts in the Yellow River Basin are decreasing from April 2002 to March 2020, while the groundwater drought in the Yellow River Basin is aggravating in recent years. (2) There is a strong link between meteorological and agricultural droughts, and the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought in summer and autumn is shorter than that in winter and spring in the two basins. When comparing the propagation time in the two selected basins, it is longer in the Yangtze River Basin. (3) Groundwater extraction may be the main factor in the aggravation of groundwater drought in the two basins, which is different from the contributors to agricultural drought, which is mainly the propagation of meteorological drought."

The case study results show that the main obstacles of the coordination system are the use of pesticides, the number of agricultural scientific and technological achievements, the application of agricultural plastic film, the number of farmers? technical training schools, and the proportion of animal husbandry. Accordingly, the paper posits suggestions, such as reducing the input of pesticides and agricultural plastic films in agricultural production, improving the social support level of agricultural science, technology, and education, and enhancing the competitiveness of animal husbandry in the Anhui Province. This study provides theoretical and methodological support for the coupled and coordinated development of regional agricultural economy, ecology and society (EES)."
480;Mapping time-to-trafficability for California agricultural soils after dormant season deep wetting;"Scott M. Devine * , Helen E. Dahlke, Anthony T. O?Geen";"Soil compaction is a threat to agricultural soil function due to constriction of macro- and meso-pores necessary for air and water movement and crop root elongation. Soils are most vulnerable to compaction when moist. Agricultural soils saturated from winter precipitation or from intentional flooding for groundwater recharge may limit growers? operational access to fields. The objective of this research was to develop guidance for rain-free ?time-to-trafficability? (including shallow workability?when a soil is conducive to both tillage and traffic) after deep wetting, using soil survey data, pedotransfer functions, and a hydroclimatological modeling approach. Trafficability is defined as a threshold of field capacity (?fc) at the soil surface (0?10 cm), ranging from 85% of ?fc (clays and silty clays) to 95% of ?fc (sands and loamy sands). The ?fc threshold is guided by the soil texture plasticity index, an indicator of compaction risk. 2911 soil profiles from soil survey databases were subjected to a wetting simulation, followed by drainage and evaporation using HYDRUS-1D across 11 locations representing mean annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) quantiles from 5% to 95%, four months (January-April), and three different years, assuming no precipitation. Rain-free time-to-trafficability was greatest in fine and loamy soils during cold months (January and February). However, seasonal effects on time-to-trafficability were more pronounced in loamy soils. Non-linear predictive functions were developed for each 0?10 cm textural class to enable mapping the typical time-to-trafficability across PET gradients, revealing clear regional and temporal patterns. Model derived estimates can inform agricultural managed aquifer recharge timing decisions and subsequent risk of soil compaction. Additional research is needed for validation and to better constrain time-totrafficability estimates for loamy and fine textured soils, which show a greater degree of uncertainty amid greater risk of compaction indicated by plasticity indices."
481;Oil prices and agricultural commodity markets: Evidence from pre and during COVID-19 outbreak;Ngo Thai Hung;"This paper represents an analysis of the spillover effects and time-frequency connectedness between crude oil prices and agricultural commodity markets using both the spillover index of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and the wavelet coherence model to evaluate whether the time-varying return spillover index exhibited the intensity and direction of transmission during the Covid-19 outbreak. Overall, the current results shed light on that in comparison with the pre-Covid-19 period, and the return spillover is more apparent during the Covid-19 crisis. However, levels of the intensity of this relationship vary through the period of research, with several intervals witnessing both negative and positive interactions. Further, our findings indicate significant heterogeneity among agriculture commodity markets in the degree of spillover to crude oil prices over time, amplifying our understanding of the economic channels through which the agriculture commodity markets are correlated. More importantly, there exist significant dependent patterns about the information spillovers across the crude oil and agriculture commodity markets might provide prominent implications for portfolio managers, investors, and government agencies."
482;Effects of smart agricultural production investment announcements on shareholder value: Evidence from China;"Weihua Liu a, * , Shangsong Long a, * , Siyu Wang a, * , Ou Tang b , Jiahe Hou a , Jiahui Zhang a";"The advent of the era of the smart economy has made agricultural production more intelligent. An increasing number of companies have launched a series of investment activities aimed at smart agricultural production (SAP). However, whether smart agricultural production investment (SAPI) impacts the stock market has yet to be confirmed. Therefore, based on the sample data of 118 listed companies in China from 2010 to 2019, this study empirically examines the impact of SAPI announcements on shareholder value, as indicated by abnormal returns of stocks. Further, we tested the moderating effect of certain characteristic factors on abnormal stock returns. The research results illustrate a significant positive connection between SAPI announcements and shareholder value. Moreover, considering the announcement content and company factors, this study investigates the impacts of different investment targets and industries on the market reaction to SAPI announcements. We find that non-agricultural companies have a more positive market reaction to SAPI than agricultural companies the higher the liability-asset ratio, the more positive will be the stock market reaction to SAPI."
483;"Comparative analysis of greenhouse gas emission inventory for Pakistan: Part II agriculture, forestry and other land use and waste";"Kaleem Anwar MIRa,d , Chunkyoo PARKb , Pallav PUROHITc , Seungdo KIMa, *";"Understanding Pakistans greenhouse gas (GHG) emission status is critical for identifying the national targets for GHG mitigation with respect to the nationally determined contributions (NDCs). This study focuses on the development of Pakistans GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) inventories for agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) and waste sectors using 2006 IPCC Guidelines. This study should be seen as a direct continuation of the preceding one (Part I [ Available online at: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accre.2020.05.002]) which discusses energy and industrial processes and product use in compliance with the 2006 and 1996 IPCC Guidelines. It also provides sector-specific comparative time series (1994e2017) analysis of GHG inventories, identification of key categories, and national GHG emissions trend for Pakistan. The results indicate an average relative difference (on average for time series 1994e2017) of 19% and 6% in total GHG emissions (CO2-eq) from AFOLU and waste sector respectively between 2006 and 1996 IPCC Guidelines. The absolute difference over the entire time series for AFOLU and waste sector was in the range of 3e67 Mt CO2-eq and 1e7 Mt CO2-eq respectively. Findings further reveal that the quantity of national GHG emissions by 2006 IPCC Guidelines is 10% lower on average for complete time series compared to 1996 IPCC Guidelines. The average relative difference for total national emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O is 1%, 9%, and 48% respectively. Key category analysis based on 2006 IPCC Guidelines estimates identified three categories, each contributing 10% to the level assessment in the latest year 2017 and accounting for approximately half of the national GHG emissions. In order to further improve the reliability of GHG inventories, Pakistan needs to move from 1996 to 2006 IPCC Guidelines under a higher Tier approach particularly for identified key categories."
484;The role of Design Thinking to promote a sustainability transition within participatory urban governance: Insights from urban agriculture initiatives in Lisbon;Sandrine Simon;"This article contributes to research into new forms of participatory urban governance aimed at creating more sustainable cities. Focused on food security, which has, like ?sustainability?, economic, ecological and socio-political dimensions, our research examines how urban agricultural initiatives have been promoted in Lisbon and how connecting and integrating them in urban planning strategies could contribute to the progressive transformation of the city into a more sustainable one. This integration is viewed as a complex, ?wicked? problem in that it encompasses various interdependent problems that are hard to solve due to the conflicting goals of involved actors. For this reason, we suggest that Design Thinking could help urban planners in addressing it, since it offers flexible, iterative and participatory ways of generating development insights based on users? needs and contexts. The way this methodology is used is illustrated here to carry out the literature review on these issues in Lisbon. From this, the centrality of food systems in concerns related to urban sustainability emerged, as well as suggestions on ways to adjust urban planning so that it takes better account of them in the future. Our research aligns with recent studies on the use of Design Thinking in urbanism, some of them dealing with the food-energy-water nexus, and provides, through urban agriculture, a practical focus of study that urban citizens might feel more capable to comment and participate on."

This study aimed to evaluate the attitudes, knowledge and practices of undergraduate students enrolled in various academic departments at the Faculty of Agriculture, Mutah University, Jordan toward pesticides? residues in food and feed. Students were questioned about their social aspects, and food and feed safety knowledge and resources. Responses have been obtained from 209 responding students. Results indicated that the cross-section through the Faculty of Agriculture, Mutah University, Jordan appears a satisfactory. The findings show that respondents are very highly concerned about human health, food safety, and the risk of environmental pollution, and they have a real desire to reduce the use of pesticides. Respondents had a moderate level of knowledge about food safety, pesticides? side effects, pesticides? residues in food or feed, and usage of pesticides in homes and gardens. According to the respondents, the most common way that people are exposed to pesticide residues is by consuming pesticide residues in food. The respondents expressed a moderate level of concern about their attitudes toward organic farming adoption. Correlations between demographic variables and knowledge of food and feed safety, involving a workshop on food/feed safety, care about human health as well as environmental pollution, and looking for information on food/feed safety were reported in the study."
486;Obstacle avoidance method based on double DQN for agricultural robots;"Yue Yu a,c , Yufei Liu a,b,* , Jichun Wang a , Noboru Noguchi d , Yong He a";"In a complex farm environment, the lack of an intelligent obstacle avoidance function is a major barrier to the large-scale adoption of automatic navigation technology for agricultural vehicles. This paper introduces a highperformance obstacle avoidance control method based on reinforcement learning. The process of obstacle avoidance is modeled to define the state and action spaces in the Double Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture, and a reward function is designed to evaluate and guide the model training. A neural network model is constructed and embedded in the Double DQN architecture to decide the output action according to the input state. To train models efficiently, three encounter situations (Confronted, Cross, and Overtaking) are established in a Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact (MuJoCo) simulation environment in which validation tests verify the stability and performance of the proposed obstacle avoidance controller. In field experiments, the averages of the shortest distance, trajectory length, and time of obstacle avoidance are 2.37 m, 0.53 m, and 2.7 s, respectively, which indicate the availability of the proposed controller. The proposed Double DQN-based controller shows a significant advantage over the traditional Risk Index-based control method in terms of both space utilization and time efficiency, and its performance facilitates automatic navigation in complex farmland."
487;"Impact of climate change on agricultural production: A case of Rasuwa District, Nepal";"Binod Dawadi a,b,* , Anjula Shrestha c , Ram Hari Acharya d , Yam Prasad Dhital e , Rohini Devkota f,g";"Climate change is expected to threaten the developing countries the most. Nepal is considered one of the five countries most vulnerable to climate change in the world. The mountainous area such as Rasuwa District in Nepal is more vulnerable due to complex topography, human activity (tourism), and climate change. In this context, we carried out this study to assess the climate change and its impact on agriculture production as well as peoples perceptions on the impact of climate change. The long-term (1980?2014) observed climate data (temperature and precipitation) and field-based survey data on peoples perceptions were analyzed. Mann-Kendall trend test and Sens slope estimation were used to analyze the temperature and precipitation trends. Furthermore, key informant interviews (KIIs) and focal group discussions (FGDs) were conducted to understand peoples perceptions of the impact of climate change on agricultural production. Further, ERA5 and APHRODITE datasets were used to compare the in situ climate data. The maximum temperature and total precipitation in summer monsoon (June?September) were found increasing significantly at rates of 0.07C/a and 19.89 mm/a, respectively. But the minimum winter temperature and winter precipitation were found decrease by 0.05C/a and 4.89 mm/a, respectively. Moreover, a large number of respondents reported a decrease in millet and wheat productions while an increase in potato production over the considered time duration (1990?2014). It is noteworthy that the respondents from the mid-elevation regions perceived an increasing trend in crop production compared to those from the low elevation regions. In recent years, people living in the high elevation regions of Rasuwa District have started to shift their cropping calendar to increase agricultural production. This study will provide useful information for policy-makers in formulating adaptation strategies in mountainous areas of Nepal."

By taking the information processing view as the theoretical lens, this study investigates precision agriculture adoption cases from two Chinese agricultural organizations to examine how they achieve highquality adoption. Interviews, secondary data collection and coding strategies were utilized to collect and analyze the data to identify the development of information processing capabilities. The research findings reveal two pathways for developing information processing capabilities through different information processing controls and networks appropriate for cooperatives (co-ops) and agricultural firms. This study contributes to the agricultural technology adoption literature by extending precision agriculture technology adoption from the adoption rate to adoption quality."
489;Rainfall shocks and crop productivity in Zambia: Implication for agricultural water risk management;"Greenwell C. Matchaya a,* , Getaw Tadesse b , Auckland N. Kuteya c";"This paper investigates the impact of erratic rainfall and related water problems on agricultural productivity. The paper also aims to shed light on the conceptual importance of understanding the incidence and impacts of rainfall shocks for choosing feasible agricultural water risk management strategies both at household and policy levels. To achieve these goals we develop a conceptual framework, use national representative data from Zambia?s crop estimates survey for 2017/2018 farming season, employ fixed effects regression approach, and find that dry spells, excessive floods, incidence of water logging are all detrimental to crop productivity. The crop-based equations also reveal the differential impacts of the rainfall shocks on different crops. Since the effect of water factors including dry spells, floods and water logging on agricultural productivity is dependent on the crop types, it is important for the Zambian government as well as other countries to take this into account when planning and implementing strategies for agricultural water risk management."
490;The impact of vegetated landscape elements on runoff in a small agricultural watershed: A modelling study;"Ine Rosier * , Jan Diels, Ben Somers, Jos Van Orshoven";"Flooding of settlements is a growing concern in Europe, also in agricultural areas. Restoration and installation of vegetated landscape elements (vLE) such as hedges, lines of trees and grass buffers, along the parcel boundaries is increasingly recognized as a way to mitigate downstream flood risk. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence to support their implementation. We used the Landlab modelling framework to gain knowledge about the importance of the presence and characteristics of vLEs for the hydrological response in a 26 ha undulating watershed representative for the Belgian loess belt for which a multitude of vLE scenarios were developed. Our model results demonstrated that the total runoff volume, the peak discharge rate and its lag time in such small watersheds are mainly controlled by the density of the vLE objects and their upstream area. First and foremost we demonstrated a negative correlation between the discharge volume and peak discharge rate and the density of the vLE objects and their upstream area. A positive correlation was observed between the lag time and density of the vLE objects for both dry and wet soils and between the lag tag time and upstream area for dry soils. Further, we found that the impact of the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil covered by the vLE became increasingly important with increasing soil wetness, with the hydraulic conductivity being negatively correlated with the discharge volume and peak discharge rate. The impact of hydraulic conductivity on the lag time was limited. A negative correlation between hydraulic conductivity and lag time for intermediate wet soils was demonstrated. Our model results also showed that the roughness, expressed as the Manning n-coefficient, of the soil underneath a vLE and the spatial connectivity of the vLE objects have little impact on the hydrological response."

492;On the influence of acquisition geometry in backscatter time series over wheat;"Maria Arias * , Miguel Angel Campo-Besc ? os , Jes? ? Alvarez-Mozos";"Dense time series of Sentinel-1 imagery are an invaluable information source for agricultural applications. Multiple orbits can observe a specific area and their combination could improve the temporal resolution of the time series. However, the orbits have different acquisition geometries regarding incidence and azimuth angles that need to be considered. Furthermore, crops are dynamic canopies and the influence of incidence and azimuth angles might change during the agricultural season due to different phenological stages. The main objective of this letter is to evaluate the influence of different acquisition geometries in Sentinel-1 backscatter time series over wheat canopies, and to propose a strategy for their correction. A large dataset of wheat parcels (~40,000) was used and 344 Sentinel-1 images from three relative orbits were processed during two agricultural seasons. The first analysis was a monthly evaluation of the influence of incidence angle on backscatter (s0 ) and terrain flattened backscatter (?0 ). It showed that terrain flattening significantly reduced the backscatter dependence on incidence angle, being negligible in VH polarization but not completely in VV polarization. Incidence angle influence in VV backscatter changed in time due to wheat growth dynamics. To further reduce it, an incidence angle normalization technique followed by an azimuthal anisotropy correction were applied. In conclusion, ?0 enabled a reasonable combination of different relative orbits, that may be sufficient for many applications. However, for detailed analyses, the correction techniques might be implemented to further reduce orbit differences, especially in bare soil periods or winter months."
493;Cooperation between specialized cropping and livestock farms at local level reduces carbon footprint of agricultural system: A case study of recoupling maize-cow system in South China;"Xiaowei Chen, Jiajun Lin, Kangming Tan, Yi Pei, Xiaolong Wang *";"Decoupling of crop and livestock production has become increasingly common in the world during to past decades. The cooperation between specialized crop and livestock farms have been paid more attention for the development of sustainable agriculture. This study assumed that rebuilding the linkage between specialized crop and livestock farms through cooperation at the local level would decrease agricultural GHG emissions. Therefore, we designed a cooperative crop-livestock farming model (CCLS) in South China by recoupling the cow farm with the sweet maize cultivation farms around it to demonstrate the hypothesis based on carbon footprint (CF) method. The CFs under two cooperative scenarios (CCLS20 and CCLS50) were compared with the corresponding decoupling models (DCLS20 and DCLS50). Results showed that CCLS significantly reduced GHG emissions from cropping systems in comparison to DCLS primarily by increasing the soil organic carbon storage while decreasing accumulative N2O emissions. In specific, the CFs of CCLS20 and CCLS50 were 48.78% and 623.34% lower than DCLS20 and DCLS50, respectively. The yield-based CFs of CCLS20 and CCLS50 were 66.30% and 165.99% lower than DCLS20 and DCLS50, respectively. Meanwhile, the CF of the cow farm in CCLS20 and CCLS50 were 8.80% and 8.22% lower than that in DCLS20/50 by lowering relative GHG emissions of straw supply in roughage forage and shortening manure storage time in the manure management process. Finally, the yield-based CF in CCLS20 and CCLS50 were 67.68% and 168.51% lower than the DCLS20 and DCLS50, respectively, demonstrating that the cooperation between specialized planting and livestock farms at local level reduced the CF of the agricultural production chain by the synergistic reduction effects of GHG emissions in cropland, livestock rearing and transportation processes. The results would provide a quantitative understanding of the net GHG emission of cooperative crop-livestock system at the local level in China and valuable information for the development of sustainable farming system in the world."
494;Stability of sodium mass fraction in agricultural certified reference materials;"M.A. Bacchi, E.A.N. Fernandes * , Y.T. Mazola, C.L. Gonzaga";"Certified values in reference materials are considered the best estimates of true values, being used for validation and verification of analytical methods. A long-term series (1998 to 2019) of neutron activation analysis (NAA) of agricultural certified reference materials was investigated at the Radioisotopes Laboratory (CENA/USP). The average sodium mass fraction in SRM 1515 Apple Leaves and SRM 1547 Peach Leaves did not agree with the certified values and the discrepancy was confirmed by triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (TQ-ICP-MS). Long-term data showed a clear increase of Na mass fraction over time. Such behavior, corroborated by results from other authors, seems to confirm the hypothesis of migration of Na from glass bottle walls into the certified reference materials."
495;Effectiveness of the new standardized deficit distance index and other meteorological indices in the assessment of agricultural drought impacts in central Italy;"L. Vergni * , A. Vinci , F. Todisco";"In the paper, we tested and compared the potential of some standardized meteorological indices to identify agricultural drought impacts in central Italy. The indices considered are the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), and the Standardized Deficit Distance Index (SDDI), a new index that is defined and evaluated in this paper. SDDI is a function of the Euclidean distance between the actual (P-ET0) and a reference deficit series (P-ET0 = max). SDDI, unlike other indices, also considers how the deficit is distributed in a certain span and assigns greater severities when the distribution is uneven (e.g., presence of peaks). The comparative analysis refers to 24 provinces of Central Italy and sunflower, a typical non-irrigated crop in the area considered. The sunflower yield time series (1980?2019) were de-trended and standardized for each province, finally obtaining Standardized Yield Residuals (SYRs). The climatic data required for calculating the drought indices (precipitation and temperatures) for each province derive from the E-OBS gridded dataset with 0.25? resolution in the period 1980?2019. From the minimum and maximum daily temperatures, the ET0 was estimated by the FAO Penman-Monteith equation. The drought indices were calculated for different time scales (from 1 to 5 months) and the months corresponding to the sunflower growing season (April?August). The performance of the various indices in the prediction of SYRs was assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. For all the indices, the best correlations are found for the 2-month time scale and for July. SPI?s performance is only slightly lower than that of the indices that integrate both precipitation and evapotranspiration (SPEI, RDI, SDDI). Among these, SDDI and SPEI provide somewhat better results considering both the percentage of significant correlation (63% and 67%, respectively) and the corresponding mean correlation (0.49 and 0.48, respectively). SDDI demonstrates good potential in assessing agricultural drought impacts while maintaining the advantage of limited data input."

With continuous reductions in the rural labour force and increasing production costs, it is urgent to develop unmanned technology for paddy field agricultural machinery to solve the problem of ?who will farm the land?. In paddy field environments with slippery mud and uneven hard underlying, side slip and slip of paddy farm machinery can easily occur. Due to the relative movement and attitude changes between paddy farm machinery and implements and the inconsistent driving track of the farm machinery and implements, it is difficult to track and control the path of unmanned paddy farm machinery. In view of the above problems, this paper takes the paddy field agricultural machinery body as the control object and the agricultural machinery pose as the observation quantity and establishes an agricultural machinery kinematics model based on agricultural machinery pose correction. Based on the model and model predictive control (MPC), the linear model, objective function and constraint function of paddy field agricultural machinery are designed, an MPC path tracking control method is established based on the pose of the agricultural machinery, and field experiments are conducted. The results show that the average root mean square error of the three-line straight-line path tracking is 0.043 m, the average absolute error is 0.033 m, and the effect is favourable. The MPC path tracking method based on the pose correction of agricultural machinery can effectively suppress abrupt lateral position deviations caused by the relative position and attitude changes of the machine, can improve the control accuracy, and can meet the control accuracy requirements of unmanned paddy field agricultural machinery operations."
497;How is urbanization shaping agricultural land-use? Unraveling the nexus between farmland abandonment and urbanization in China;"Dawei Hou a,d , Fanhao Meng b,c,* , Alexander V. Prishchepov d";"Urbanization often results in agricultural expansion but can also lead to farmland abandonment. However, it remains unclear about the extent, exact timing and determinants of farmland abandonment in response to ongoing urbanization. Using the example of China?s Sunan economic region, we present the spatiotemporal trajectories of farmland abandonment and recultivation from 2001 to 2018. We classified Landsat satellite image time-series with a regression trees classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Further, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns and rates of farmland abandonment and recultivation. Spatially-explicit logistic regressions were applied to explore the determinants of farmland abandonment in space and time. Our results show widespread farmland abandonment: approximately 232,700 ha of farmland had ever been abandoned from 2001 to 2018, with the highest annual abandonment rate (8.5%) in 2017. Approximately 66,200 ha of abandoned fields were later recultivated, with the maximum recultivated area (13,600 ha) in 2018. Approximately 92% of abandoned fields were later recultivated or reused as the impervious surface within two years of the first detection of abandonment, suggesting more rapid land transformation. The regressions reveal that locational and socio-economic factors determined farmland abandonment patterns. Specifically, a higher likelihood of farmland abandonment was statistically associated with an increased distance from the nearest settlements the significantly positive relationship between ?Non-agricultural GDP? and farmland abandonment strengthened over time. In contrast, a lower likelihood of farmland abandonment was observed in areas with more cash crops. The statistical results may extend the application of the Ricardian comparative advantage theory along with Alonso?s bid rent theory to explain and predict abandonment patterns in response to ongoing urbanization. Our study is the first attempt in China to apply 30-m Landsat imageries to reconstruct abandonment patterns over long timeseries. The findings provide important insights into adjusting land-management practices for preventing farmland abandonment due to urbanization."

499;"The close relationship between biophysical degradation, ecosystem services and family farms decline in Spanish agriculture (1992?2017)";"Gloria Isabel Guzman? a,* , David Soto Fernandez ? b , Eduardo Aguilera c , Juan Infante-Amate d , Manuel Gonzalez ? de Molina a";"In this paper, we examine the evolution of Spanish agriculture from 1992 to 2017, exploring the specific relationship between the agricultural population and the provision of agroecosystem services (AE-S). Traditionally, family farming has sustained the quality of the biophysical fund elements of agroecosystems through the work that family members have invested both in productive and reproductive tasks. Therefore, changes in the size and composition of the agricultural population and farm types are bound to have consequences on the quality of such fund elements and, consequently, on the AE-S provision. To verify this hypothesis, we adopted the Agrarian Metabolism approach. The results showed that the value of Spanish agricultural production has continued to grow thanks to productive specialisation and the increase in irrigation, protected crops and intensive livestock farming. This has led to a significant increase in intermediate consumption, to the detriment of agricultural income. This, in turn, has favoured the growth of a more intensive agricultural sector, which is environmentally pernicious, and has dramatically reduced the number of family holdings. The receding of family farming has led agroecosystems to deteriorate, due both to the fall in the amount of work invested in reproductive tasks, and their exclusion from land management."
500;Environmental sustainability in agriculture: Identification of bottlenecks;"Jussi Lankoski a,* , Leena Lankoski b";"Increasing the environmental sustainability of the agriculture sector is an important policy goal for many governments. This study employs Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) to identify potential necessary conditions (bottlenecks) and to assess their required levels for achieving strong and weak environmental sustainability outcomes in agriculture. Based on data from selected OECD countries, the results show that there are several necessary conditions, including both structural and policy conditions, for achieving high environmental sustainability. More specifically, the results show that low production intensity and low livestock density and cropland share are necessary conditions for high environmental sustainability. These, in turn, are affected by past and present production-coupled agricultural support policies (especially market price support and output payments) that constrain the achievement of high environmental sustainability. It is therefore important to reduce the levels of these support measures to enable higher environmental sustainability in agriculture."
501;Tele-connection of global agricultural land network: Incorporating complex network approach with multi-regional input-output analysis;"Mengyao Cheng a , Jialu Wu a , Chaohui Li c , Yuanxin Jia a , Xiaohua Xia a,b";"The geographical distribution imbalance of global agricultural land has been reduced as a result of increasing globalization, which accelerates land redistribution through global supply networks. In turn, interregional trade extends the control of land resources beyond of local borders. However, the specific structural features of agricultural land flow patterns embodied in international trade remain unclear from the perspective of a complex network. In this paper, we integrate multi-regional input-output model and complex network theory to reveal the structural characteristics of the global embodied land flow network (GELFN) in multiple dimensions. Globally, GELFN exhibits small-world nature, indicating that embodied land transfer interconnects economies at a high level. Regionally, GELFN has a basic community structure of seven groups, and economies in the same regional economic cooperation organizations, such as NAFTA, EU and AU, are more likely to cluster in the same community, implying that GELFN embodies the characteristics of multi-polarization and intra-region aggregation. Nationally, by introducing resource endowments and network-based measurements, we classify seven groups of key economies (?connection clusters?) to identify different land use patterns. Moreover, the core-periphery structure of GELFN confirms that a few economies act as hubs associated with a large amount of land transfer. The results emphasize the importance of multi-regional cooperation on global agricultural land management and well-targeted policies in key economies and sectors."
502;Evaluation of agricultural drought in South Korea using socio-economic drought information;"Ji-Wan Lee a , Eun-Mi Hong b,* , Jin-Uk Kim a , Won-Jin Jang a , Chung-Gil Jung c , Seong-Joon Kim d";"The effect of drought on agriculture is a complicated result of several factors. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate agricultural drought using facility monitoring or statistical data. However, the gap in awareness between the public monitoring of drought and local situations has not been sufficiently reduced. The objectives of this study were to analyze the correlation between a socioeconomic drought information (SEDI) based on Internet news articles and agricultural drought data and to determine whether the SEDI can provide reliable information regarding damage due to agricultural drought. The SEDI was subdivided into the following aspects: water deficit, water security and support, economic damage and impact, and environmental and sanitation impact. The correlation coefficient between SEDI and eight agricultural statistical datasets ranged from 0.74 to 0.89. In moderately dry irrigation and non-irrigation periods, the relationship between SEDI and the agricultural reservoir drought index (RDI) was evidenced by a receiver operating characteristic and an area under the curve of 0.60 and 0.68, respectively. The crosscorrelation values between the SEDI and RDI ranged from - 0.48 to - 0.42. According to crosscorrelation analysis, SEDI was able to detect drought one month earlier than the RDI was able to do. Thus, our proposed method can contribute to the development of an impact-based early warning system for agricultural drought management."
503;"Agricultural drought characteristics in a typical plain region considering irrigation, crop growth, and water demand impacts";"Yuliang Zhang a,b,c , Zhiyong Wu b,* , Vijay P. Singh c,d , Qingxia Lin e , Shaowei Ning a , Yuliang Zhou a , Juliang Jin a , Rongxing Zhou a , Qiang Ma a";"Hydrological models and drought indices based on simulation of soil moisture have been widely used in largescale agricultural drought assessments. However, hydrological models often oversimplify crop modules and does not consider irrigation, crop growth, and water demand impacts. Therefore, in the present study, a coupled hydrological-crop growth model Variable Infiltration Capacity - Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (VICEPIC) was used to consider the impact of the irrigation process on drought and propose a crop water anomaly percentage index (CWAPI) based on the crop water demand and consumption processes. Identification and assessment methods of drought events were also evaluated. The validation results of the VIC-EPIC model showed that the correlation coefficients between the MODIS evapotranspiration and the simulated evapotranspiration at 37% merged grids were above 0.74. The correlation coefficient (0.79) of the CWAPI-simulated values and statistical values of drought area rates was greater than that (0.72) of soil moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI), indicating that the simulation of drought area rate based on CWAPI was more reasonable. After identifying regional drought events and comparing the identified characteristic values of these events with the average drought data of each city, it was found that SMAPI misjudged some regions with high hydraulic conductivity as severe drought regions. This limitation was overcome by CWAPI, which directly reflects the degree of crop water shortage and considers the impact of irrigation on drought. Agricultural drought occurs due to low soil water content, which is caused by rapid percolation of soil water and insufficient storage of local and irrigation water. This study of drought indices will help develop a more timely and comprehensive adaptive strategy to deal with droughts by considering the impacts of irrigation, crop growth, and water demand on drought."
504;"A DNA-barcode biodiversity standard analysis method (DNA-BSAM) reveals a large variance in the effect of a range of biological, chemical and physical soil management interventions at different sites, but location is one of the most important aspects determining the nature of agricultural soil microbiology";"Mat?s Fernandez-Huarte ? a,b,* , John G.

Simmons g , Lucie Ma?skova? g , Lynda K. Deeks g , Matthew R. Goddard a";"There are significant gaps in our understanding of how to sustainably manage agricultural soils to preserve soil biodiversity. Here we evaluate and quantify the effects of agricultural management and location on soil microbiology using nine field trials that have consistently applied different soil management practices in the United Kingdom using DNA barcode sequence data. We tested the basic hypothesis that various agricultural management interventions have a significant and greater effect on soil bacterial and fungal diversity than geographic location. The analyses of soil microbial DNA sequence data to date has lacked standardisation which prevents meaningful comparisons across sites and studies. Therefore, to analyse these data and crucially compare and quantify the size of any effects on soil bacterial and fungal biodiversity between sites, we developed and employed a post-sequencing DNA-barcode biodiversity standard analysis method (DNA-BSAM). The DNA-BSAM comprises a series of standardised bioinformatic steps for processing sequences but more importantly defines a standardised set of ecological indices and statistical tests. Use of the DNA-BSAM reveals the hypothesis was not strongly supported, and this was primarily because: 1) there was a large variance in the effects of various management interventions at different sites, and 2) location had an equivalent or greater effect size than most management interventions for most metrics. Some dispersed sites imposed the same organic amendments interventions but showed different responses, and this combined with observations of strong differences in soil microbiomes by location tentatively suggests that any effect of management may be contingent on location. This means it could be unreliable to more widely extrapolate the findings from trials performed only at one location. The widespread use of a standard approach will allow meaningful cross-comparisons between soil microbiome studies and thus a substantial evidence-base of the effects of land-use on soil microbiology to accumulate and inform soil management decisions."
505;Effectiveness of side-inlet vegetated filter strips at trapping pesticides from agricultural runoff;"Meghan Arpino a,? , Jody Stryker a , John Hanzas a , Michael Winchell a , Mark Anthony Thomas b , Jerome Schleier III c , Don Meals a";"Agriculture can be a contributor of pollutants, including pesticides and excess sediment, to aquatic environments. However, side-inlet vegetated filter strips (VFSs), which are planted around the upstream side of culverts draining agricultural fields, may provide reductions in pesticide and sediment losses from agricultural fields, and have the additional benefit of removing less land from production than traditional VFS. In this study, reductions of runoff, the soluble pesticide acetochlor, and total suspended solids were estimated using a paired watershed field study and coupled PRZM/VFSMOD modeling for two treatment watersheds with source to buffer area ratios (SBAR) of 80:1 (SI-A) and 481:1 (SI-B). Based on the paired watershed ANCOVA analysis, runoff and acetochlor load reductions were significant following the implementation of a VFS at SIA but not SI-B, indicating the potential for side-inlet VFS to reduce runoff and acetochlor load from a watershed with an area ratio of 80:1 but not a higher ratio of 481:1. VFSMOD simulations were consistent with the results of the paired watershed monitoring study, where simulated reductions of runoff, acetochlor loads, and TSS loads were substantially lower for SI-B than SI-A. VFSMOD simulations of SI-B with the SBAR ratio observed at SI-A (80:1) also show that VFSMOD can be used to capture variability in effectiveness of VFS based on multiple factors including SBAR. While this study focused on the effectiveness of sideinlet VFSs at the field scale, broader adoption of properly sized side-inlet VFSs could improve surface water quality at the watershed or larger scales. Additionally, modeling at the watershed scale could aid in locating, sizing, and assessing the impacts of side-inlet VFSs at this larger scale."
506;Integrated surface and groundwater modeling to enhance water resource sustainability in agricultural watersheds;"Henrique G. Momm a,* , Ronald L. Bingner b , Katy Moore a , Glenn Herring b";"Management of water resources is essential to maintain sustainable agricultural productivity and preserve groundwater and surface ecosystems. The long-term sustainability of these systems depends on the understanding of complex surface-groundwater flow interactions at different temporal and spatial scales, and the impacts of agricultural practices on water use. To support these efforts, an integrated AnnAGNPS-MODFLOW modeling technology is proposed and evaluated. It combines the capability of the AnnAGNPS model to detailed characterization of farming practices with groundwater flow estimation tools of the MODFLOW model. The AnnAGNPS-MODFLOW model was evaluated in Upper Sunflower River watershed at the Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Plain. The integrated modeling technology in conjunction with observed values of streamflow at the outlet and well water levels were used to estimate irrigation strategies with application rates varying in time and space at field scale. Utilization of improved irrigation characterization have provided evidence of the sensitivity of streamflow and groundwater levels to irrigation strategies. Simulation results indicate that a reduction of irrigation application rates by 20?40% can impact aquifer long-term water levels. This finding supports the need to investigate more efficient irrigation strategies to promote the aquifer sustainable use. The proposed technology provides a management tool critical to understanding and evaluating the impact of agricultural practices, irrigation, and aquifer recharge strategies that are important to sustaining water resources in irrigated agricultural watersheds."

A review";"Soibam Ngasotter a , K.A.Martin Xavier a,* , Maibam Malemngamba Meitei a , David Waikhom a , Madhulika a , Jyotirmoy Pathak b , Soibam Khogen Singh c";"Chitin, a widely available natural polymer, is the fundamental structural component of crustacean shells. The crustacean processing industry produces a lot of shell waste each year (in millions), most of which is discarded and poses serious environmental problems. This waste can be effectively utilized to produce chitin and chitin nanomaterials with superior physicochemical and biological properties, making it applicable in various industries. In this context, this review outlined the chitin extraction methods from crustacean shell waste. The recent advancements in chitin nanomaterial isolation in the form of chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs) and chitin nanofibers (ChNFs) from purified chitin are discussed. Furthermore, the current practical applications of chitin and chitin nanomaterials in agriculture, biomedicine, and the food industry are reviewed to better understand the polymer?s applicability for future research and development."
508;Integration of Sentinel-1/2 and topographic attributes to predict the spatial distribution of soil texture fractions in some agricultural soils of western Iran;"Kamran Azizi, Younes Garosi, Shamsollah Ayoubi * , Samaneh Tajik";"This research was intended to examine the use of radar data obtained from Sentinel-1 imagery with different combinations of topographic attributes and multispectral data to predict soil texture fractions (STFs) in some agricultural soils located in the southern part of Kurdistan province, in western Iran. For this purpose, by applying the stratified random sampling technique, 216 soil samples were collected from the upper soil layer (0?30 cm) of the studied area. The particle size fractions were measured using the hydrometer method. Then, a comprehensive set of environmental variables including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and digital elevation model (DEM) were derived. These environmental variables were included in four datasets these included: dataset A (Sentinel-2 and DEM), dataset B (Sentinel-1 and DEM), dataset C (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), and data set D (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and DEM). After selecting the parsimonious variables in each dataset based on Pearson correlation coefficients and variance inflation factor (VIF) analyses, three machine learning models including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), Cubist, and the ensemble of individual models were used to create the statistical link between environmental variables and STFs. The results showed that the ensemble modeling method with the dataset D had the highest accuracy in comparison to individual models in the prediction of clay (RMSE = 4.07%, MAE= 3.22%, ME= - 0.08, CCC= 0.53), silt (RMSE = 5.96%, MAE=4.63%, ME=- 0.52, CCC=0.49), and sand fraction (RMSE = 8.32%, MAE=6.46%, ME= 0.52, CCC=0.55). In addition, the results of variable importance revealed that all three types of environmental variables contributed to the prediction of the spatial distribution of STFs. These results also showed that elevation, Band 11 and VH_1 (which is the one provided by the radar data obtained from Sentinel-1), respectively, were the most important variables in the prediction of clay and sand fractions. In addition, Band 11, elevation, and multi-resolution valley bottom flatness index (MrVBF) were identified as the most important variables contributing to the prediction of the silt fraction. This study also demonstrated the effectiveness of backscatter coefficients obtained from Sentinel-1 in digital soil mapping (DSM) in the prediction of soil properties. Finally, the map of each fraction with its uncertainty and also, the soil texture map were generated from the ensemble model and dataset D. These maps could be used as the decision tools for agricultural management."
509;"Coal seam gas extraction and related landscape changes in the agricultural production area of Western Downs (Queensland, Australia)";"Giorgia Bressan, Michel Deshaies";"In Australia, coal seam gas (CSG) could help to meet growing demands for cleaner alternatives to coal, thus making it important for the energy transition. By developing such an industry, not only does an energy resource become available, but large water volumes are also extracted, especially in the first stages of production. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impacts of a large-scale coal seam gas industry on the landscape. Specifically, the research intends to explore how coal seam gas has changed the landscape of the agricultural production area in Western Downs, Queensland. In this Australian State, the water associated with coal seam gas production is considered an asset and the legislation in force encourages beneficial use of such resources. Comparison of aerial pictures highlights how, in a short timeframe, the local rural landscape has changed considerably due the extensive development of unconventional gas resources. The coal seam gas industry has provided the host region with opportunities for local development, but the issue of the sustainability of these new mining and non-mining activities still needs to be properly addressed."
510;Sugarcane yield estimation through remote sensing time series and phenology metrics;"Dimo Dimova,* , Johannes H. Uhl b , Fabian L?d , Gezahagn Negash Sebokac";"Accurate agricultural yield prediction is a fundamental tool for sustainable agricultural planning and to ensure food security in regions critically affected by climate change and extreme weather events. Existing regressionbased crop yield estimation approaches typically rely on a specific set of predictor variables, but have not been compared systematically. This paper demonstrates and compares the utilization and the combinatorial use of three different sets of object-based predictors for sugarcane yield estimation through the agricultural monitoring platform ag|knowledge which utilizes earth observation data of the Sentinel-2 satellites, captured between 2018 and 2019 for a study area of about 10,000 hectares in Ethopia. We compare several regression models using a range of different predictor variables, such as (i) multi-temporal variables (i.e., parcel-based vegetation index time series), (ii) time series descriptors (i.e., phenological metrics) and (iii) spatio-temporal variables. We achieve R2 scores of up to 0.84 for the estimation of sugarcane yield and up to 0.82 for the estimation of sugar quantity through Random Forest regression, based on the combinatorial use of all predictor variables. Our experiments demonstrate that dimensionality-independent phenological metrics achieve good yield estimation results which could be a very useful variable set for model transfer and domain adaptation."
511;Moving towards agriculture 4.0: An AI-AOI carrot inspection system with accurate geometric properties;"Sze-Teng Liong a , Yi-Liang Wu a , Gen-Bing Liong b , Y.S. Gan c,";"This paper aims to give a new impetus to the development of automated inspection systems in the food industry, specifically by examining the geometric properties of agricultural products using computer vision technology. The proposed framework is designed to replicate the conditions of a manufacturing industry, in which a roller conveyor transports randomly arranged products. Despite this challenging environment, the proposed framework is able to accurately identify the geometric properties of each product, including width, length, area, and volume. Succinctly, a suite of novel image processing is introduced such as the techniques of object detection, semantic segmentation, and object tracking. Particularly, the use of a depth sensor allows for the enhancement of image information by providing a corresponding depth matrix for each RGB image. The agricultural product experimented with herein is the carrot, which has a range of sizes/ shapes and is widely produced in many countries. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, the proposed framework demonstrated high accuracy in estimating the length, width, and volume of carrots, with average errors of 1.85%, 2.51%, and 5.35% when tested on a sample of 20 carrots and a total of 3120 images. This work offers promising potential for improving food production efficiency in the manufacturing industry and should inspire further research in this area."
512;Towards nutrient neutrality: A review of agricultural runoff mitigation strategies and the development of a decision-making framework;"Martin J. Luna Juncal a,b,c , Pietro Masino d , Edoardo Bertone a,b,c,? , Rodney A. Stewart a,b";"Nutrient runoff from agriculture practices poses a significant risk to waterway health and can have long-lasting and complex implications for the environment, ecosystems, and the human population. Consequently, a systematic quantitative literature review (SQLR) was conducted to identify different nutrient runoff mitigation strategies (NRMS) that are currently used globally to prevent or remediate environmental damage from excessive agricultural fertilisation. Empirical data on the outcomes from various NRMS from the reviewed studies were used to evaluate the strategies based on environmental benefit, implementation cost, and practicality perspectives. An overall assessment of the feasibility of NRMS was determined, and a macro-level assessment of the reported barriers preventing the widespread implementation of NRMS was provided. Identified research gaps and issues included a dearth of literature covering nutrient runoff mitigation, scepticism from agricultural landowners to voluntarily adopt policy without substantial incentives, and a general lack of cost/benefit analyses, including an understanding of the uncertainty associated with NRMS that can inform decision-makers about effective and efficient strategies for different site situations. Synthesis of SQLR data facilitated the development of a comprehensive nutrient runoff decision-making framework which addresses present limitations and provides site-specific NRMS recommendations for policymakers to implement."
513;Association between rural electrification and agricultural output: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa;"Salome Amuakwa-Mensah a,* , Yves Surry b";"This paper explores the association between rural electrification and agricultural output at the macro level using panel data on 43 Sub-Saharan African countries from 1990 to 2016. We employed Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) with time trend and country fixed effect in our econometrics estimation to address the potential serial correlation. Our study investigates the following i) the association between rural electrification and agricultural output, measured as agricultural output per GDP and agricultural output per worker, ii) whether the relationship between rural electrification and agricultural output is conditional on institutional quality of a country, and iii) whether electrification enhances the marginal effect of factor inputs. We find a positive significant association between rural electrification and agricultural output. Also, our result shows that the relationship between electrification and agricultural output is conditional on the quality of institution and factor inputs of a country. With the exception of capital, the association between the interaction term of rural electrification and factor inputs (labour and land), and agricultural output is negative. However, we find a higher positive direct relationship between labour and agricultural output per GDP, implying a higher productivity for those labour who remain in the sector. Our results are heterogenous across population size quartiles sub-samples."
514;Valorization of agricultural wastes for biofuel applications;"Omojola Awogbemi * , Daramy Vandi Von Kallon";"Continuous environmental degradation, volatility in the oil market, and unimpressive functioning of fossil-based (FB) fuels in compression ignition engines have expanded the tempo of the search for alternative fuels. Due to the astronomical rise in global population, improved agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing activities, enhanced farming and other food production and utilization ventures, agricultural waste generation, renewable fuel consumption, and emission of toxic gases. The need for cost-effective, readily available, and environmentally benign agricultural waste to biofuels has never been more crucial. Biofuels are renewable, biodegradable, lowcost, and eco-friendly fuels that are produced by microorganisms from waste lignocellulosic biomass. Conversion of agricultural wastes to biofuel does not exacerbate food security, contributes to waste management, prevents environmental degradation, and ensures energy security. This study reviews the conversion of agricultural wastes into biofuels with special emphasis on bioethanol, biohydrogen, biobutanol, biomethane, biomethanol, and biodiesel for various applications. It is safe to conclude that wastes generated from agricultural activities and processes are useful and can be harnessed to meet the affordable and accessible global renewable energy target. The result of this investigation will improve the body of knowledge and provide novel strategies and pathways for the utilization of agricultural wastes. Going forward, more collaborative and interdisciplinary studies are required to evolve state-of-the-art, ecofriendly, and cost-effective conversion pathways for agricultural wastes to promote the utilization of the generated renewable fuels. More human, financial, and infrastructural investments are desirable to motivate the conversion of agricultural waste into biofuels to ensure environmental sanitation and sustainability, promote renewable fuel utilization, and avert the raging implosion of our planet."
515;The role of renewable energy and natural resources for sustainable agriculture in ASEAN countries: Do carbon emissions and deforestation affect agriculture productivity?;"Ritika Chopra a , Cosimo Magazzino b,* , Muhammad Ibrahim Shah c , Gagan Deep Sharma a , Amar Rao d , Umer Shahzad e";"The adoption of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in 2015 shifted the attention towards sustainabilityrelated concerns in both developing and developed counties. The aim of this paper is to examine how agricultural productivity ? a key driver in achieving many of these SDGs ? is affected by carbon emissions, deforestation, renewable energy consumption, natural resources, and regional integration for the ten Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. Using the Mean Group (MG) class estimators, able to tackle the cross-sectional dependence in the data, empirical findings reveal that environmental degradation (in the form of CO2 emissions) reduces agricultural productivity in the region. Both the forest area and natural resource variables negatively affect the productivity of the agricultural sector, while the use of renewable energy sources positively contributes to the agricultural sector. However, despite being one of the highest integrated regions in the world, regional integration among the ASEAN members does not boost their agricultural productivity. The causality tests confirm the existence of bidirectional causality between agricultural productivity and renewable energy consumption, and unidirectional causality across a few other variables. Accordingly, the study provides policy recommendations for the governments of ASEAN economies on improving the environmental performance of agriculture and achieving the SDGs by 2030."
516;Signs of agricultural sustainability: A global assessment of sustainability governance initiatives and their indicators in crop farming;"Jason Konefal a , Evelien M. de Olde b,* , Maki Hatanaka a , Peter J.M. Oosterveer c";"CONTEXT: To address sustainability challenges in agriculture, private and multi-stakeholder initiatives increasingly use sustainability indicators to monitor the sustainability impact of farms. These indicators can be part of standards for certification or assessment tools to measure farm performance. While these initiatives play an important role in navigating the sustainability transition, insight in how these governance initiatives operationalize sustainability in crop farming is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines how private and multi-stakeholder governance initiatives, which increasingly regulate the sustainability of a sizeable portion of agriculture globally, operationalize the concept of sustainability. It provides understanding into which sustainability themes are commonly included in sustainability initiatives, and those that are not, which can give insight into the direction these initiatives are steering crop production worldwide. METHODS: We developed an overview of governance initiatives using databases and existing research on sustainable agriculture initiatives. Documentation about these initiatives was gathered and used to systematically review descriptive and institutional characteristics of the 29 sustainability assessment and standard initiatives. Moreover, we analyzed the kinds of indicators (i.e., performance, practice, and target) and the themes that are prioritized in the environmental, social, and economic dimensions of sustainability."

518;LiDAR applications in precision agriculture for cultivating crops: A review of recent advances;"Gilberto Rivera, Ra? Porras, Rogelio Florencia * , J. Patricia S?chez-Sol?";"In recent years, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has been one of the most innovative subjects in laser scanning, remote sensing, and object detection systems. This technology may be popular because it can pinpoint structures or zones of interest in millimetre detail. It can also highlight variations and irregularities, such as surface degradation and vegetation growth. This paper presents a review of the specialised literature on LiDAR systems applied to precision agriculture specifically, in cultivating crops. First, some preliminaries of LiDAR systems according to the mode of transport used, considering terrestrial, mobile, and aerial laser scanners, are given. Subsequently, a well-organised taxonomy of recent LiDAR applications based on the activity being performed is presented. Here, the following four categories are considered: (1) crop-related metric estimation, (2) tree and plant digitisation, (3) vision systems for object detection and navigation, and (4) planning and decision support. Lastly, we discuss some current trends and research challenges in applying LiDAR technology to cultivation activities in accordance with the state-of-the-art literature."
519;Has COVID-19 accelerated the E-commerce of agricultural products? Evidence from sales data of E-stores in China;"Jianxin Guo a,1 , Songqing Jin b,c,*,1 , Jichun Zhao a , Hongbiao Wang a , Fang Zhao d";"We investigated the operation of e-stores specializing in food and agricultural products before and after the occurrence of COVID-19. A difference-in-difference (DID) method was employed to estimate the relationship between COVID-19 and the online sales of agricultural products using data from 164,002 food and agricultural product e-commerce stores (in short, e-stores) of two major Chinese e-commerce platforms in 120 prefecturallevel or above cities. The results demonstrated that while COVID-19 and its control measures were associated with a substantial growth in the monthly sales of food and agricultural product e-stores, the growth varies considerably across store scales and with the type of food and agricultural product in which an e-store is specialized. Micro stores experienced much larger growth and played a more important role in maintaining the resilience of the supply chain of food and agricultural products than larger-scale stores stores selling more essential food items experienced larger growth than those selling leisure food items. A mechanism analysis further revealed that the growth of online sales of agricultural products was mainly driven by changes in consumers? food purchase behaviors from offline channels to online channels (i.e., an increase in the number of online customer orders and price per online order) starting with the onset of COVID-19. The results of this paper underscore the importance of e-commerce in maintaining the resilience of the agri-food supply chain and call for public support of the development of micro- and small-scale e-stores to meet consumers? increasing demand for food supply from those types of stores during the pandemic period."
520;Determination of spatiotemporal characteristics of agricultural non-point source pollution of river basins using the dynamic time warping distance;"Kang Wanga , Pengxiang Wanga , Renduo Zhangb,? , Zhongbing Lina,b";"The aims of this study were to develop a method to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of agricultural non-point source (ANPS) pollution loads at the basin scale, and to identify the dominant processes and factors responsible. Time series of water flow and NH4 +-N, TN, and TP loads at sub-basin outlets in the Qujiang and Fujiang river basins were obtained using a model calibrated with field measured data. The dynamic time warping (DTW) distances of flow rate and ANPS pollution loads between a sub-basin outlet and the basin outlet were calculated using the time series at the sub-basin outlet and the basin outlet. The DTWs were divided into clusters to evaluate the differences in variation, information content, and similarity among ANPS pollution load time series at the various spatial scales. Results showed that the proposed method could successfully identify the critical spatial scale of the basin. In the sub-basins smaller than the critical spatial scale, ANPS pollution loads were primarily affected by the land surface hydrological processes. In the sub-basins larger than the critical spatial scale, ANPS pollution loads were affected mainly by the river hydrological processes. In the Qujiang river basin, the spatial DTW clusters of ANPS pollution loads were similar to those of the water flow. In the sub-basins smaller than the critical scale, distinguishing factors for the ANPS pollution loads clusters were (from most to least important) stream order (i.e., the spatial scale), land use, and soil nutrient content. In the Fujiang river basin, the spatial DTW clusters of the three pollutants were similar. Distinguishing factors for the ANPS pollution loads clusters were (from most to least important) slope, land use, and soil nutrient content. This method developed can be used as a practical technique to characterize spatial and temporal distributions of ANPS pollution in river basins."
521;"Mapping of crop types and crop sequences with combined time series of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data for Germany";"Lukas Blickensdorfer ? a,b,* , Marcel Schwieder b,c , Dirk Pflugmacher b , Claas Nendel d,e,f,g , Stefan Erasmi c , Patrick Hostert b,f";"Monitoring agricultural systems becomes increasingly important in the context of global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth, and the rising demand for agricultural products. High-resolution, national-scale maps of agricultural land are needed to develop strategies for future sustainable agriculture. However, the characterization of agricultural land cover over large areas and for multiple years remains challenging due to the locally diverse and temporally variable characteristics of cultivated land. We here propose a workflow for generating national agricultural land cover maps on a yearly basis that accounts for varying environmental conditions. We tested the approach by mapping 24 agricultural land cover classes in Germany for the three years 2017, 2018, and 2019, in which the meteorological conditions strongly differed. We used a random forest classifier and dense time series data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 in combination with monthly Sentinel-1 composites and environmental data and evaluated the relative importance of optical, radar, and environmental data. Our results show high overall accuracy and plausible class accuracies for the most dominant crop types across different years despite the strong inter-annual meteorological variability and the presence of drought and nondrought years. The maps show high spatial consistency and good delineation of field parcels. Combining optical, SAR, and environmental data increased overall accuracies by 6% to 10% compared to single sensor approaches, in which optical data outperformed SAR. Overall accuracy ranged between 78% and 80%, and the mapped areas aligned well with agricultural statistics at the regional and national level. Based on the multi-year dataset we mapped major crop sequences of cereals and leaf crops. Most crop sequences were dominated by winter cereals followed by summer cereals. Monocultures of summer cereals were mainly revealed in the Northwest of Germany. We showcased that high spatial and thematic detail in combination with annual mapping will stimulate research on crop cycles and studies to assess the impact of environmental policies on management decisions. Our results demonstrate the capabilities of integrated optical time series and SAR data in combination with variables describing local and seasonal environmental conditions for annual large-area crop type mapping."
522;Analysis of land surface temperature variation based on MODIS data a case study of the agricultural pastural ecotone of northern China;"Baocheng Wei a , Yuhai Bao a,b , Shan Yu a,b , Shan Yin a,b,* , Yufeng Zhang a,*";"The agricultural pastural ecotone of northern China (APENC), as one of the world?s four agro-pastural ecotones, is a typical fragile ecological zone and sensitive zone responding to global climate change. The thermal environment pattern of APENC has been dramatically changed due to intensive human disturbances, especially the land use/land cover change induced by a series of ecological restoration projects implementation after 1999. Few studies focused on land surface temperature (LST) variation in this region due to the lack of long time series remote sensing data. The spatial, temporal and trend characteristics of LST were quantitatively analyzed at different timescales based on a long-term sequence of MODIS data in APENC (2003?2020). Results showed that (i) the thermal pattern of APENC was dominated by high LST areas and very high LST areas at an annual and seasonal timescale. These regions mainly distributed in Yellow River Basin, southeast boundary and vast plains in the northeast. The high value of absolute variability (AV) mainly occurred in the western of Yinshan-Greater Khingan Mountains and northeast of APENC. Meanwhile, the AV was largest in winter and then decreased from spring to fall. The fluctuation degree of AV was largest in summer while the slightest in fall. (ii) The LST exhibited insignificantly and rapidly warming during 2003?2007 and 2012?2014, respectively. Whereas the significant cooling trend occurred during 2007?2012 and 2014?2020. (iii) The LST showed a warming trend at an annual, spring and winter timescale since the increasing trend in nighttime was faster than the decreasing trend of LST in daytime. The cooling trend occurred in fall and summer because the decreasing range of LST in daytime was greater than the increasing nighttime trend. These results will provide an important regional demonstration for climate change study of arid and semi-arid region and a reference for agricultural and livestock production for APENC."
523;Drought and flood risk assessment for rainfed agriculture based on Copula-Bayesian conditional probabilities;"Wentong Yang , Liyuan Zhang * , Yu Gao";"Rainfed agriculture ensures global food security. However, periodic droughts and floods endanger rainfed crop productivity. This work aims to identify drought and flood risks in rainfed agriculture using conditional probabilities and to reduce food losses caused by drought and floods. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index is produced from 1996 to 2020 using meteorological data from the three northeastern provinces and is used to establish four time-scale drought indicators. The Pearson correlation coefficient is then used to identify drought indicators related to rainfed crop production. The Copula-Bayesian conditional probabilities were used to calculate the probability of yield reduction of rainfed crops when drought indicators indicate varied drought and flood conditions. The results show that: (1) Droughts from May to July and floods from January to March had the most significant impact on rainfed crops in the three northeastern provinces. (2) The cities of Huludao, Changchun, Baishan, Baicheng, Yanbian, Hegang, and Jiamusi face a more significant danger of drought in rainfed crops. In contrast, Yichun and Suihua face a higher risk of flooding in rainfed crops. (3) When drought monitoring indicators decreased by one unit, rainfed crop output declined the most in Fuxin city when the drought indicator increased by one unit, rainfed crop yield decreased the most in Liaoyuan city. The study?s findings can provide quantitative direction for food security work in China?s three northeastern regions."
524;Recent advances in image fusion technology in agriculture;"Daoliang Li a,b,c,d,* , Zhaoyang Song a,b,c,d , Chaoqun Quan a,b,c,d , Xianbao Xu a,b,c,d , Chang Liu a,b,c,d";"Crop and livestock monitoring are essential for guiding agricultural production and improving agricultural yield by facilitating the early prevention and treatment of diseases, yield prediction, and automatic harvesting. However, traditional monitoring methods have some shortcomings, including by humans and through a single sensor, manual monitoring method is time-consuming and labor-intensive, monitoring methods using a single sensor are inaccurate. Therefore, research on improving the methods of crop and livestock monitoring is essential. Image fusion technology can help provide important information from two or more images that can be used to obtain comprehensive agricultural information. After discussing the advantages and disadvantages of various of image fusion methods in agriculture, this paper reviews the application of image fusion in crop recognition and detection, planting area estimation, plant diseases and pest detection, and livestock health assessment and classification. It also highlights the main challenges to the successful application of image fusion technology to agriculture, and discusses directions of future research and development directions in the area."
525;"The impact of extensive agricultural water drainage on the hydrology of the Kleine Nete watershed, Belgium";"Estifanos Addisu Yimer a,? , Fatima-Ezzahra Riakhi a , Ryan T. Bailey b , Jiri Nossent a,c , Ann van Griensven a,d";"Agricultural water drainage can significantly lower groundwater levels and affect catchment hydrology. Therefore, building models with and without these features can indicate an adverse impact on the geohydrological process. Therefore, the standalone Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+) model was initially developed to simulate streamflow at the Kleine Nete catchment outlet. Next, a physically based and spatially distributed groundwater module (gwflow) was integrated into the SWAT+ model and calibrated for stream discharge at the catchment outlet. Finally, the same model was calibrated for both streamflow and groundwater heads. These final model parameters are used to investigate the basin-wide hydrologic fluxes with and without including agricultural drainage systems in the model scheme. The result suggested that the standalone SWAT+ model poorly represented the stream discharge and attained low NSE values of 0.18 and 0.37 during the calibration and validation periods, respectively. Integrating the gwflow module to SWAT+ improved the model representation of stream discharge (NSE = 0.91 and 0.65 for calibration and validation periods, respectively) and groundwater heads. However, calibrating the model for only streamflow resulted in a high root mean square error (above 1 m) for groundwater head, and the seasonality is not captured. On the other hand, calibrating the coupled model for streamflow and hydraulic head reduced the root mean square error (below 0.5 m) and captured the seasonality of groundwater level fluctuations. Finally, drainage application resulted in a 50 % (from 33.04 mm to 16.59 mm) reduction in groundwater saturation excess flow and an 18.4 mm increment in drainage water to streams. To conclude, the new SWAT+gwflow model is more appropriate than the standalone SWAT+ model for the case study. Furthermore, calibrating the SWAT+gwflow model for streamflow and groundwater head has improved the model simulation, with implications for general coupled models where representing surface and groundwater in the calibration strategy is beneficial."
526;Comprehensive analysis of services towards enhancing security in IoT-based agriculture;"Sakshi Anand a,* , Avinash Sharma b";"The Internet?s ever-increasing popularity may be attributed to its ubiquitous accessibility. At this point, IoT has reached its pinnacle, with a wide variety of devices and appliances effectively linked to sensors & Internet, ushering in a new age of convenience and connectivity. It is challenging to secure because of the diverse combination of sensors, the Internet, and objects. Using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, farmers may control their crops and agricultural fields remotely. Recent studies have concentrated on finding ways to improve precision agriculture?s security infrastructure. Prior efforts to improve security services in the case of precision agriculture enabled by IoT have been minimal. By resolving issues related to cluster key management and overcoming obstacles associated with web interface configuration, the proposed work has established a novel approach that enables cluster key management to enhance security. Additionally, a web interface for gathering information from sensor nodes has been developed. After an IoT sensor detects a signal, the user may handle notifications using a web interface. When dealing with the vast infrastructure of IoT, it may be challenging to ensure the security of individual sensor nodes, particularly when only partial details about the hardware and the capacity for deployment are available. As a result, key management has emerged as a critical issue, especially in light of the node-capturing assault. Using the EBS function Object() { [native code] } and the Chinese remainder theorem, this research provides a new method of cluster key management that may improve agricultural accuracy. After collecting information from the nodes, the Backend Server sends a filtered list, together with preloaded keys and an authentication code, to the Cluster Head. This system incorporates a secondary layer of encryption for further protection. Our proposed method outperforms existing strategies in terms of delivery success rate, energy efficiency, and packet loss."
527;Historical climate change impacts on the water balance and storage capacity of agricultural reservoirs in small ungauged watersheds;"Mirza Junaid Ahmad a , Gun-ho Cho b , Kyung Sook Choi c,";"Study region: Agricultural reservoirs are the principal source of irrigation supplies for sustaining rice production and play a critical role in the water resource management of South Korea. Study focus: We comprehensively evaluated the performance of 400 major agricultural reservoirs, spread throughout the country, as a function of climate change during 1973?2017 considering the constituents of reservoir water balance, such as watershed runoff, irrigation water demand, and evaporation loss. New hydrological insights: Based on the trend analysis during the 45-year study period, the reservoir inflows remained higher than the irrigation water demands because of the gradually increasing annual rainfall. Most reservoirs had enough storage capacities their resilience gradually declined particularly during the last 15 years. The northern and northeastern region reservoirs had acceptable resilience whereas the reservoirs in the western and southwestern inland and coastal regions showed insufficient resilience. Reservoirs received sufficient inflows but the residence time of the excess inflow has to be increased to suffice the peak irrigation demands in the coming cropping season. Study outcomes could help prioritize the reservoirs requiring immediate rehabilitation located in the central and southwest regions with high failure risks. Results suggested that a reservoir with a watershed-irrigated area ratio > 5 would have a better chance of coping with future climate change threats."
528;Enabling forecasts of environmental exposure to chemicals in European agriculture under global change;"John D. Hader a,1 , Taylor Lane b,1 , Alistair B.A. Boxall b , Matthew MacLeod a,? , Antonio Di Guardo c";"European agricultural development in the 21st century will be affected by a host of global changes, including climate change, changes in agricultural technologies and practices, and a shift towards a circular economy. The type and quantity of chemicals used, emitted, and cycled through agricultural systems in Europe will change, driven by shifts in the use patterns of pesticides, veterinary pharmaceuticals, reclaimed wastewater used for irrigation, and biosolids. Climate change will also impact the chemical persistence, fate, and transport processes that dictate environmental exposure. Here, we review the literature to identify research that will enable scenario-based forecasting of environmental exposures to organic chemicals in European agriculture under global change. Enabling exposure forecasts requires understanding current and possible future 1.) emissions, 2.) persistence and transformation, and 3.) fate and transport of agricultural chemicals. We discuss current knowledge in these three areas, the impact global change drivers may have on them, and we identify knowledge and data gaps that must be overcome to enable predictive scenario-based forecasts of environmental exposure under global change. Key research gaps identified are: improved understanding of relationships between global change and chemical emissions in agricultural settings better understanding of environment-microbe interactions in the context of chemical degradation under future conditions and better methods for downscaling climate change-driven intense precipitation events for chemical fate and transport modelling. We introduce a set of narrative Agricultural Chemical Exposure (ACE) scenarios ? augmenting the IPCCs Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) ? as a framework for forecasting chemical exposure in European agriculture. The proposed ACE scenarios cover a plausible range of optimistic to pessimistic 21st century development pathways. Filling the knowledge and data gaps identified within this study and using the ACE scenario approach for chemical exposure forecasting will support stakeholder planning and regulatory intervention strategies to ensure European agricultural practices develop in a sustainable manner."
529;"Trade, productivity, and the spatial organization of agriculture: Evidence from Brazil";Heitor S. Pellegrina1;"This paper studies how regional productivity shocks in agriculture propagate to the rest of the economy via trade and migration linkages, shaping their aggregate effects on GDP, welfare, and agricultural employment. Using comprehensive agricultural data from Brazil, I estimate a general equilibrium model with a rich spatial structure to evaluate the effects of a critical shock in modern agriculture: the adaptation of soybeans to tropical regions. Results show that this shock increased Brazil?s agricultural GDP by 4%?6%, with the bulk of this impact coming from international trade. Because soybeans are land-intensive relative to other agricultural sectors, agricultural employment fell in tropical regions to which soybeans expanded. In other parts of the economy, however, agricultural employment rose substantially. Additionally, I show that general equilibrium effects have important implications for the analysis of the returns to agricultural research and the evaluation of the reduced-form effects of productivity shocks on agricultural employment."
530;Information and communication technology-based service platform enabling the co-creation of agrometeorological services: A case study of the Laos Climate Services for Agriculture;"Kwang-Hyung Kim a,* , Monica Petri b , Khambane Inthipunya b , Viengxai Manivong c , Juhyeong Han a , Jongsun Park d , Leo Kris Palao e , Sengduangduan Phouthanoxay c , Sengkeo Keomanivong c , Sengchanh Silattana c , Viengkham Chanthavong c , Sayphone Phommaya c , Phousavanh Siyavong c";"Climate services for agriculture (agrometeorological services) are only possible through collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts. To this end, a national-scale service operated by centralized governments will mandate institutional coordination for data sharing, in addition to designated staff time and budget commitments for effective and sustainable operation however, previous efforts have revealed that institutional coordination, particularly between meteorology and agriculture, represents the most difficult part preventing successful implementation in most countries. In this study, we examined the use of a top-down, information and communication technology (ICT)-based multidisciplinary platform for agrometeorological services for facilitating institutional coordination and ensuring project sustainability. The Strengthening Agro-climatic Monitoring and Information Systems (SAMIS) project, operational since 2018, focuses on building the adaptive capacity of agrometeorological services in Laos by combining the agricultural and meteorological sectors. The research here utilized the ICT-based service platform Laos Climate Services for Agriculture (LaCSA) to systematically engage relevant institutional partners in the co-creation process of agrometeorological services. The results showed that LaCSA enabled cocreation, including data sharing, collaborative tool use, institutional coordination, and policy support from multiple government entities across the agricultural and meteorological sectors. Key lessons and suggestions included co-training for both sectors, easy-to-use data management processes, early buy-in for policy makers, and creating standard operating procedures designating staff time and budgets. These results indicate that the coordinated operation of agrometeorological services through an ICT-based service platform can be successfully achieved in Laos as well as other developing countries, where institutional disconnects and human capital constraints hinder successful implementation of agrometeorological services."
531;Urban agriculture and its biodiversity: What is it and what lives in it?;"H. Royer a,b,* , J.L. Yengue a , N. Bech b";"Whereas cities continue to grow at the expense of agricultural and natural areas, the interest for urban agriculture (UA) is on the rise. Its popularity comes from its ability to address issues specific to the city including nature conservation. We question here what is currently known about UA in terms of definition and existing forms and also what biodiversity is able to live in it. Several definitions of UA co-exist, showing three common points: (i) the location on an urban territory, (ii) the activity itself and (iii) its inclusion in conventional or alternative food systems. Some authors suggest studying UA within the inter-communality area as it is difficult to establish a delimitation between rural and urban. Many forms of UA can be found in cities, from old ones: gardens, private or collective, occurring or maintained mainly in times of crisis ? to newest forms: (micro)urban farms or green spaces. Activities are diverse with the possibility of growing vegetables, fruit trees and raising animals (recently allowed back in cities of the Global North). A review on the biodiversity found on these areas shows that under favourable conditions of management and surrounding land use, UA would also be able to harbour a noticeable biodiversity and contribute to nature conservation in cities. Further research is needed to better understand the ecological implication of UA. Nevertheless, we recommend considering UA for its benefits provided to humans but also to non-human beings as a habitat."
532;Agricultural revolution and industrialization;"Angus C. Chu a , Pietro F. Peretto b , Xilin Wang c";"This study explores how agricultural technology affects the endogenous takeoff of an economy in the Schumpeterian growth model. Due to the subsistence requirement for agricultural consumption, an improvement in agricultural technology reallocates labor from agriculture to the industrial sector. Therefore, agricultural improvement expands firm size in the industrial sector, which determines innovation and triggers an endogenous transition from stagnation to growth. Calibrating the model to data, we find that without the reallocation of labor from agriculture to the industrial sector in the early 19th century, the takeoff of the US economy would have been delayed by about four decades."

In this study, three types of carbohydrate beads, prepared of agar, alginate and gellan- gum, were tested for their environmental impact during a soil biodegradation process. To assess this impact the following measurements were taken: (1) soil-respiration (emitted CO2, O2 and CH4) by respirometer, (2) measuring emissions of volatile organic compounds by proton-transfer-reaction-time of flightmass-spectrometer and (3) residual phytotoxicity in the soil after the degradation process by greenhouse study. The results demonstrate that in a simulation system of soil degradation that lasted 40-days, the alginate macro-beads had the highest respiration rate with ~217 CO2(mg/g_dw) vs only 40 CO2(mg/g_dw) for agar and none for gellan gum. This study provides evidence for the first time, that a distinctive volatile organic fingerprint cam be detected during the biodegradation process of different carbohydrates (59 m/z for agar, 114, 115 m/z for alginate and 81 m/z for all three). The emission of the volatile organic compounds which dissipated after a week of biodegradation in the soil, suggests that most of the metabolic activity was in the first week. Agar degradation showed a slight residual phytotoxicity affecting the growth of the consecutive crop (disappeared over time). These results can help to establish a future monitoring system for the degradation process of gum-beads that would better estimate the environmental impact and the beads? fate in actual use in soils."
534;"Occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of PAHs and OPAHs in urban agricultural soils from Guangzhou City, China";"Weisong Chen , Weixuan Xian , Guiying He , Zhongye Xue , Shaomin Li , Wenyan Li , Yongtao Li , Yulong Zhang * , Xingjian Yang";"The occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) derivatives in the environment is of growing concern because they exhibit higher toxicity than their parent PAHs. This study evaluated the large-scale occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of 16 PAHs and 14 oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs) in urban agricultural soils from seven districts of Guangzhou City, China. Linear correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between PAH and OPAH occurrence and a series of parameters. The compositional analysis, principal component analysis, diagnostic ratios, and principal component analysis coupled with a multiple linear regression model were used to identify the sources of PAHs and OPAHs in the soils. The average concentrations of SPAHs and SOPAHs (59.6 ? 31.1?213 ? 115.5 ?g/kg) during the flood season were significantly higher than those during the dry season (42.1 ? 13.3?157.2 ? 98.2 ?g/kg), which were due to relatively strong wet deposition during the flood season and weak secondary reactions during the dry season. Linear correlation analysis showed that soil properties, industrial activities, and agricultural activities (r = 0.27?0.96, p < 0.05) were responsible for the spatial distribution of PAHs during the dry season. The PAH distribution was mainly affected by precipitation during the flood season. The concentrations of SOPAHs were only related to the soil properties during the dry season because their occurrence was sensitive to secondary reactions, climate and meteorological conditions, and their water solubility. Our results further showed that coal combustion and traffic emissions were the dominant origins of PAHs and OPAHs during both the seasons. Wet deposition and runoff-induced transport also contributed to PAH and OPAH occurrence during the flood season. The results of this study can improve our understanding of the environmental risks posed by PAHs and OPAHs."
535;The Interplay between the Internet of Things and agriculture: A bibliometric analysis and research agenda;"Abderahman Rejeb a , Karim Rejeb b , Alireza Abdollahi c , Fadi Al-Turjman d , Horst Treiblmaier e,*";"The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has fundamentally reshaped the agricultural sector. In recent years, academic research on the IoT has grown at an unprecedented pace. However, the broad picture of how this technology can benefit the agricultural sector is still missing. To close this research gap, we conduct a bibliometric study to investigate the current state of the IoT and agriculture in academic literature. Using a resource-based view (RBV), we also identify those agricultural resources that are mostly impacted by the introduction of the IoT (i.e., seeds, soil, water, fertilizers, pesticides, energy, livestock, human resources, technology infrastructure, business relations) and propose numerous themes for future research."
536;Spectral signature analysis of false positive burned area detection from agricultural harvests using Sentinel-2 data;"Daan van Dijk a,* , Sorosh Shoaie b , Thijs van Leeuwen b , Sander Veraverbeke a";"Accurate mapping of burned area is of key importance for fire emissions modeling and post-fire rehabilitation planning. In this research, Sentinel-2 data were used to analyze the difference in spectral signature between burned area and false positives from agricultural harvests. 26 fires that were mapped in the field using Global Navigation Satellite System during 2017 and 2018 were analyzed over California and Utah, USA. Individual Sentinel-2 bands and a wide range of commonly used spectral indices for burned area were tested using a spectral separability index. The separability index assessed discrimination between the classes burned area and 1) unburned area and 2) area in agricultural land that were flagged as false positive from agricultural harvest. Separability values higher than one indicate good separation and the higher the values, the better the separation. For each class, we first determined the multitemporal difference, i.e. the absolute value of the pre-minus-postchange value. Second, we compared with other classes by using the spectral separability index. We found that for the burned-to-unburned comparison the near and shortwave infrared spectral regions and spectral indices that make use of these spectral regions, were the best discriminators (separability (M) values of approximately 2), corroborating findings from earlier works. For the burned-to-agricultural false positive comparison Sentinel-2 bands 4 and 5, corresponding with the Red and Red-edge spectral regions, were the best discriminator (M- values greater than 2). Consequently, spectral indices containing the Red band show a similar strong separability of agricultural false positives. The results from our research reveal an additional layer of information that could be exploited to minimize false positives in agricultural lands in space-borne burned area products."
537;Credit access and agricultural technology adoption nexus in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis;Yohannes Girma;"Access to credit is a good way to overcome some of the financial obstacles associated with technology adoption by the farmers. In Ethiopia the potential effect of credit on technology adoption is controversial. To determine the overall direction of effect a meta-analysis was done using a total 42 studies. The random effect model and meta regression analysis were applied to unveil the potential effect of credit access on farmers? technology adoption in Ethiopia. The result showed that in Ethiopia farmers adopted agricultural technologies such as chemical fertilizer, high yielding varieties, livestock technologies, soil and water conservation practices, beehive technologies, poultry technologies and ICT technologies. The random effect model output showed that access to credit increases agricultural technology adoption of farmers by 1.23unit, as compared to farmers who have no access to credit. The result from the meta regression output also depicted that family size total livestock holding and total income were the main factors that determine heterogeneity in the effect of credit access on farmers? technology adoption among farmers. It was concluded that credit is essential to improve technology adoption however, most farmers in Ethiopia have collateral problems to have access to credit for the adoption of technologies. It was recommended that a lot of improvement is needed from the government and private financial institutions to widen credit provision for the rural communities without collateral which could boost the financial power of the farmers so as to purchase technologies from the market."
538;The impact of energy poverty on agricultural productivity: The case of China;"Hongxu Shi a , Hao Xu a , Wei Gao a , Jinhao Zhang a , Ming Chang b";"With scholars increasingly focusing on the threat to sustainable development posed by energy poverty, additional discussion on the energy poverty (EP)-agricultural technical efficiency (ATE) relationship is especially beneficial for achieving food security and agricultural sustainability. As such, using data from 30 Chinese provinces from 2002 to 2019, this study investigates the dynamic effect of EP on ATE by employing a system generalized method of moments approach. The results indicate that EP can significantly lower ATE. The heterogeneity analysis revealed that, as ATE increases, the negative effects of EP continue to wane, while the positive effects of industrial structure become more pronounced. Additionally, northern China?s agricultural production is more vulnerable to EP. Based on an investigation of potential mechanisms, it appears that off-farm work is a significant channel through which EP adversely affects ATE. There are a lot of important policy implications from this paper because it adds to the existing body of knowledge and shows how to reduce the effects of EP on ATE."
539;An innovative digitization evaluation scheme for Spatio-temporal coordination relationship between multiple knowledge driven rural economic development and agricultural ecological environment? Coupling coordination model analysis based on Guangxi;"Wei Liu*, Wei Zhou, Lexian Lu";"The agricultural ecological environment is the premise and foundation of rural economic development and the rural economy is an important manifestation of the vitality of the agricultural ecological environment. Taking 14 prefecture-level cities in Guangxi as the research object, this paper collects and sorts out the relevant data indicators of rural economy and agricultural ecological environment of them from 2007 to 2019, constructs the evaluation index system, calculates the development index by using the comprehensive index function, and finally uses an innovative digitization evaluation scheme to further evaluate the spatiotemporal coupling and coordination relationship between the rural economy and agricultural ecological environment. The following conclusions are ultimately drawn. First, the comprehensive level index of the rural economy shows linear growth with unbalanced regional development (values from 0.306 to 0.598). Second, the comprehensive index of the agricultural ecological environment shows fluctuating growth with obvious regional differences (values from 0.264 to 0.483). Third, the development of rural economy and agricultural ecological environment is not synchronized, and there is mutual influence. Fourth, the coordination level of the rural economy and agricultural ecological environment is low (coupling values from 0.369 to 0.513). Then, policy inspirations are proposed. First, the investment in agricultural science and technology innovation should be increased and the modern agricultural technology system. Second, agricultural industrial structure should be optimized and the agricultural industrial chain. Third, the construction of agricultural infrastructure should be improved, and the high-quality development of agriculture should be promoted. Fourth, the education of ecological civilization should be strengthened, and awareness of ecological and environmental protection should be established. Fifth, they should strengthen education and training and cultivate new professional farmers. Sixth, they should improve the utilization rate of land and enhance the arable land production capacity."

Edward Schofield m, Mike Simmonds n , Frank Chambers o , Catherine Barnett e,p , Martyn Waller q";"Land-use change plays an important role in shaping plant and insect diversity over long time timescales. Great Britain provides an ideal case study to investigate patterns of long-term vegetation and insect diversity change owing to the existence of spatially and temporally extensive environmental archives (lake sediments, peatlands, and archaeological sites) and a long history of landscape transformation through agrarian change. The trends identified in past environmental datasets allow the impacts of land-use change on plant and insect diversity trends to be investigated alongside exploration of the emergence of ecological novelty. Using fossil pollen, insect (beetle), archaeodemographic, archaeobotanical and modern landscape datasets covering Britain, similarities are identified between insect diversity and pollen sample evenness indicating that vegetation heterogeneity influences insect diversity. Changing land use captured by archaeobotanical data is significantly correlated with pollen diversity demonstrating the role of human activity in shaping past diversity trends with shifts towards ecosystem novelty identified in the form of non-analogue pollen taxa assemblages (unique species combinations). Modern landscapes with higher agricultural suitability are less likely to have pollen analogues beyond the last 1000 years, whilst those in areas less suited to agriculture and on more variable topography are more likely to have analogues older than 1000 years. This signifies the role of agriculture in the creation of novel ecosystems. Ecological assemblages characteristic of earlier periods of the Holocene may persist in areas less affected by agriculture. The last 200 years has witnessed major shifts in novelty in a low number of pollen sites suggesting that novel ecosystems emerged over a longer time period resulting from the cumulative impacts of land-use change."
541;Dynamics of improved agricultural technologies adoption: The chicken and maize paradox in Ethiopia;"Mulugeta Y. Birhanu a,* , Nathaniel Jensen b";"Empirical evidence on the dynamics of agricultural technologies adoption and dis-adoption is lacking. We applied a dynamic random effect probit model on a repeated measure of improved chicken and maize adoption to explore the state dependence of households? adoption decisions and associated factors. Results indicate interventions that initiated the initial adoption decision of an improved variety of maize seeds had a long-term structural and positive effect on subsequent adoption decisions, while this was not observed in improved chicken breed adoption. The absence of true state dependence in improved chicken breed adoption suggests the limited effects of interventions that initiated the initial adoption decisions to bring structural effects on subsequent adoption decisions. The divergence in persistent adoption decisions could be associated with observed and unobserved household heterogeneity, including technology generation and delivery systems, extension and advisory services, access to allied inputs and finance, access to market, and household location. Policy options to promote sustained adoption of agricultural technologies should consider introducing innovative and contextspecific technology delivery systems and farm and household characteristics that can trigger persistent adoption beyond initiating the initial adoption decisions."

Optimization models for solving multi-period planning problems are proposed, able to decide how to allocate crops in each growing season in order to maximize the total expected profit. The allocation decisions are made considering the crop rotation benefits across seasons and the sustainable requirements stated by current regulations. A complexity analysis is performed, and polynomial special cases are presented. Integer Linear Programming models are proposed, for a case study related to structured professional Italian farms specialized in arable crops, following sustainability rules coming from public regulations and private initiatives, i.e., the Common Agricultural Policy by the European Union and ??La Carta del Mulino?? by the Barilla Group. Numerical experiments conducted on real data show the effectiveness of the proposed solution approaches."

Masek Lopezd , Blake Winklere , Kenedy Hublerf";"Known as the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), the US Forest Service is planning a large-scale restoration of ponderosa pine forests in the Verde River watershed in central Arizona, USA. This paper uses a reduced-form econometric regression model with 1969?2010 time-series data to estimate the economic benefits of the increased water yield due to planned forest restoration of the first phase of 4FRI. We split the data sample into 1969?1989 and 1990?2010 time periods, and conclude during the second time period, water use is statistically and economically significant. This is consistent with the reality that the Verde River watershed has been in drought since the early 1990s. Our central finding is, if water use increases by 1%, the farm income will increase by 1.33%. If a 5?10% increase in water yield caused by the first phase of the 4FRI is all used by agriculture, agricultural income will increase by 6.65?13.3% annually."

Sophisticated techniques (i.e. modelling) have been applied in the last decades worldwide for accurate LULC classification and future projections. However, using these techniques in heterogeneous agricultural regions to extract crop-related information is still challenging. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of crop pattern prediction for the year 2050 with the CLUE-S model in an agricultural plain. The model was calibrated and validated based on the LULC changes to model future changes of the crop pattern by 2050. Twelve driving factors were utilised to quantify the relationship of LULC classes. The statistical relationship among the factors was examined with a Binomial Logistic Regression approach. Additionally, the magnitude of change in agricultural crop patterns between 2015 and 2050 was calculated according to local/regional policies and incorporated to the model as scenario layer. Future model results indicated that the cotton would increase by % 45 whereas maize would decrease by % 10 compared to 2015. The model performance was evaluated using the ground truth from the field observations considering the agricultural policies through the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) indicators. The mean ROC value for the agricultural crop patterns was calculated as 0.71, while ROC values for other LULC classes were over 0.90. Overall a 0.79 ROC value was achieved as the model accuracy."

The Agricultural IoT is inseparable from wireless communication. However, in traditional agricultural IoT router and gateway site selection, the influence of the actual terrain on transmission loss is not considered, which results in node power wastage and increased maintenance costs. Based on a multi-sensor fusion algorithm, a fast terrain sampler is designed in this study to collect point-cloud data of the experimental site terrain. A reasonable objective function is then designed under the premise of consideration of the electromagnetic wave free-space and diffraction losses, and the locations of the routers and gateway are optimized based on k-means and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Simulations show that the running time of the PSO algorithm is very sensitive to the changes in the execution parameters, and the improved PSO algorithm converges faster than the genetic algorithm (GA) in all three initialization methods. After collecting field terrain data, five interpolation methods were compared, and the nearest-neighbor algorithm is used to obtain the terrain model. On-site collection of received signal-strength indication (RSSI) shows that the communication quality of the optimal point selected via this algorithm is significantly higher than those of nearby points. At the same time, it is proved that the RSSI data has serious discontinuities, so the traditional gradient descent method is not suitable for solving the objective function in this work. Therefore, the algorithm used herein is of great significance for the site selection of agricultural Internet of Things nodes. However, since there are many ways to calculate the diffraction loss, the objective function of this work still needs more correction studies. The tool proposed in this work can obtain a 3D model of farmland faster than traditional surveying and mapping methods. With future research, the 3D model may be applied to soil moisture analysis, rainfall and moisture direction inversion, and plant light exposure prediction."
546;Does global value chain participation and positioning in the agriculture and food sectors affect economic performance? A global assessment;"Pierluigi Montalbano a,b,* , Silvia Nenci c";"The availability of aggregate data on trade in value added provides an unprecedented opportunity to carry out a global empirical assessment of the geography of global value chains (GVCs) in the agriculture and food sectors and their relative economic importance for the ?Global South?. To study GVCs worldwide, we use the broad sample of 189 countries for the period 1995?2015 in the multi-region input-output EORA database in which all continents and income-levels are more properly represented. Specifically, we compute GVC participation and positioning indicators for agriculture and food sectors to test their effects on changes in agriculture value added per worker. To this end, we apply a macro version of the reduced form of the standard constant returns to scale Cobb-Douglas production function with labour, land, capital, augmented with GVC indicators. Results show that changes in GVC participation are, on average and ceteris paribus, positively associated with changes in agriculture value added per worker, net to time-invariant confounders. In contrast, upstream positioning is found to be negatively associated with agriculture value added, on average and ceteris paribus. The presence of heterogeneity by geographical location confirms that a general universal relationship does not exist. These outcomes provide valuable empirical-based insights for policymaking."
547;"Agricultural yield, food nutrition and dietary energy supply in Nigeria: Evidence from nationally representative data";"Oreoluwa Ibukun Akano a , Folasade Olubunmi Oderinde b , Abiodun Olusola Omotayo c,*";"Producing sufficient food to satisfy nutritional needs is imperative for building a prosperous society. This study examined trends in agricultural yields, water and sanitation services, and nutrition indices in Nigeria. Secondary data from the FAO-FAOSTAT (2000?2020) were utilized and analyzed using descriptive statistics, the respective coefficients of variation and determination, the Mann-Kendall trend test, the Pearson correlation and multivariate regression for statistical inferences. The results show trends for data on several variables. GDP per capita and population numbers were positively correlated with the number of children under five years of age who were stunted, and the proportion of population and number of people using safely managed and at least basic drinking water and sanitation services. A major result was the significant positive relationship between cassava yield and number of children under five who were stunted. Also, there was the negative influence of population numbers on cassava and maize yields. If not attended to, the outcomes of these relationships are expected to exacerbate nutrition insecurity and stunting in children under five. An improvement in the national indices on agricultural yields and nutrition security is imperative for the accelerated attainment by 2030 of the national nutrition security targets and the SDGs."
548;Modelling climate variabilities and global rice production: A panel regression and time series analysis;"Masha Joseph a , Stephan Moonsammy a,* , Harold Davis a , Devin Warner c , Ashley Adams a , Temitope D. Timothy Oyedotun b";"Climate change threatens agriculture and it remains a present global challenge to food security and Sustainable Development Goals. The potential impact on the supply of crops such as rice is seen as a major food security issue that requires intervention on several fronts. The literature on rice production, climate variations and climate change show several studies outlining various impacts on rice supply as a result of variations in temperature and rainfall. This study intends to further explore the impacts on rice production caused by temperature changes and rainfall variation by analyzing and modelling the production of rice by the top rice-producing countries globally. A time series of the national rice production and yield along with national average annual temperature and rainfall were sourced for 15 major rice-producing countries. The trends of the time series were then compared between the rice productivity variables and temperature and rainfall. A panel regression model was also developed to further assess the relationship between rice production and temperature and rainfall. The time series showed that rice production and yield are increasing for the majority of the countries analyzed. The panel regression model however showed that continued increase in temperature can result in decreased production of rice and that rainfall volume directly impacts rice output and therefore shows rice production is highly susceptible to flooding and drought events caused by climate variabilities."
549;Mapping cropland extent using sentinel-2 datasets and machine learning algorithms for an agriculture watershed;"Chirasmayee Savitha a,* , Reshma Talari b";"Mapping and monitoring cropland extents are among the most appreciated element for resource management, monitoring, and assessment. India, being the most densely inhabited and agronomical country, mapping highresolution cropland extent provides appreciated statistics and data for various resource management practices from an individual farm unit to larger administrative units. However, currently available cropland extent maps at global, continental, and regional extents are derived from coarser resolution satellite imageries. For smaller administrative unit with areas less than 10,000 Ha, these coarse resolution maps, often misclassify, resulting in uncertainties in accurate cropland accuracy. To overcome these limitations, in this study an effort is made to develop 10-m fine-resolution cropland extent maps using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 datasets for a watershed in Tadepalligudem, India. The selected study area is an agriculture dominant watershed covering an area of 5375 Ha. The satellite datasets used for the present study are selected with minimum cloud cover and are timecomposited over three crop seasons (Kharif, Rabi, and Zaid). With the successful advent of machine learning methods in remote sensing applications, cropland extent maps are derived using Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised machine learning algorithms in R-Studio, an R-programming interface. RF and SVM are CART-based machine learning algorithms, where the performance of RF depends on the number of trees (?ntrees?) and the number of sampled features (?mtry?), while for SVM it depends on Kernel functions used. To rejoice the need to develop a fine resolution, a comparative analysis is performed between 10- m resolution Sentinel-2 derived cropland extent maps and commonly used 30-m resolution Landsat-8 OLIderived products. Training and testing samples collected from the field observations and high-resolution Google Earth Pro-is divided in a ratio of 75:25. In the present study, the accuracy of the classified cropland extent maps are validated with ground truth for both satellite sources and machine learning methods. The accuracy of the maps is assessed using Overall Accuracy (OA), and kappa coefficient derived from the confusion matrix. With an OA and kappa co-efficient of 92.8% and 0.86 (RF) respectively and 94.3% and 0.89 (SVM) respectively, classified cropland extent maps from Sentinel-2 datasets have been shown to outperform Landsat-8 derived maps. From the comparative analysis between the two machine learning methods, classified cropland extent maps obtained using the SVM algorithm, have been shown to outperform maps obtained using RF with greater OA and kappa coefficient values. The methodology adopted in this study finds its potential in delineating cropland from noncropland regions predominantly in small agriculture watersheds with an accuracy of 0.01 ha per pixel."
550;"(Re)assessing Climate-Smart Agriculture practices for sustainable food systems outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa: The case of Bono East Region, Ghana";"Philip Tetteh Quarshie a,b,* , Seidu Abdulai c , Evan D.G. Fraser d";"This research paper assesses the reality of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices? potential to promote the outcomes of sustainable food systems (SFS) within Ghana?s smallholding agriculture context. The study demonstrates that rural farmers generally perceive CSA?s contribution to ?food and nutrition security? and ?economic performance? as more important than CSA?s contribution to ?social equity? and ?environmental stewardship?. From a narrow perspective, the study demonstrates that farmers perceive CSA?s potential to ?prevent pest and disease outbreaks? and ?increase human capital information? as the most important contribution of CSA to SFS outcomes. In contrast, CSA?s potential to promote environmental stewardship is perceived as the least important among Ghana?s rural farmers. This enormity of displacement of smallholders? perceptions at large is motivated by demographic, socioeconomic and ecological factors. Moreso, the CSA for SFS outcomes narratives is driven by farmers? self-apprise, social networks and other local information dissemination agents. Furthermore, research findings suggest farmers? awareness of CSA practices and interventions is deficient owing to unmet training and information needs for approximately 82% of the CSA practices and interventions. This situation elucidates the dichotomy of CSA practices? narratives as tools for attaining food, nutrition security and economic performance to the detriment of critical issues such as increasing awareness and building farmers? capacity to engage with CSA practices while also managing socio-ecological trade-offs that emerge over time due to engagement with CSA. Critical (re)orientation is needed across the scale to drive CSA practices and interventions that confine climate adaptation and food production practices within safe planetary boundaries without undermining social, economic, food and nutrition security needs."
551;"Irrigation area, efficiency and water storage mediate the drought resilience of irrigated agriculture in a semi-arid catchment";"Bruce Lankford a,? , Catherine Pringle b , Jon McCosh b , Mlungisi Shabalala b , Tim Hess c , Jerry W. Knox c";"We examined the effects of hydrological variables such as irrigation area, irrigation efficiency and water storage on the resilience of (mostly commercial) irrigated agriculture to drought in a semi-arid catchment in South Africa. We formulated a conceptual framework termed ?Water, Efficiency, Resilience, Drought? (WERD) and an accompanying spreadsheet model. These allow the resilience of irrigated agriculture to drought to be analysed via water accounts and a key resilience indicator termed Days to Day Zero (DDZ). This represents the number of days that a pre- and within-drought supply of catchment water available to irrigation is withdrawn down to zero in the face of a prolonged drought. A higher DDZ (e.g. >300 days) indicates greater resilience whilst a lower DDZ (e.g. <150 days) signals lower resilience. Drought resilience arises through land and water management decisions underpinned by four types of resilience capacities absorptive, adaptive, anticipative and transformative. For the case study, analyses showed that irrigators, with currently approximately 23,000 ha under irrigation, have historically absorbed and adapted to drought events through construction of water storage and adoption of more efficient irrigation practices resulting in a DDZ of 260 days. However, by not fully anticipating future climate and water-related risks, irrigators are arguably on a maladaptive pathway resulting in water supply gains, efficiency and other practices being used to increase irrigation command areas to 28,000 ha or more, decreasing their capacity to absorb future droughts. This areal growth increases water withdrawals and depletion, further stresses the catchment, and reduces future DDZs to approximately 130 days indicating much lower drought resilience. Our approach, supported by supplementary material, allows stakeholders to understand the resilience consequences of future drought in order to reconcile competition between rising water demands, consider new water storage improve agricultural and irrigation planning and enhance catchment governance."

This mechanism results in widespread land tenure adjustments in a specific arrangement of rights, partnerships, and structures, which is in direct opposition to the existence of land as a small and necessary asset. While several attempts have been made to clarify land tenure conflicts, and scholars have studied them from different perspectives, there is still a significant gap in our knowledge of land tenure-related conflicts in the agricultural system and their production. As a result, this paper examined 85 pieces of literature (from 2013 to 2021) on the impact of land registration on the link between land tenure and agricultural productivity in Iran and throughout the world. Land tenure arrangements in Iran are evolving as a result of land demand and improvements in agricultural techniques, according to the results. Furthermore, each land tenure scheme can include a variety of land types, each with its own set of rules and patterns for use. The findings showed that further research with a combined locally-set methodology is required to better understand any relationship(s) between land tenure system (LTS) and agricultural production (AP), in addition to highlighting the value of land knowledge updating and the efficiency of local land management institutions. This study concluded that explaining land-related conflicts, mechanisms of power, and legal actions are important steps toward guiding the consequences of the growth of agricultural LTS in Iran, which leads to effective solutions at the area level."
553;How can public policy encourage private investments in Indian agriculture? Input subsidies vs. public investment;"Nusrat Akber a , Kirtti Ranjan Paltasingh a , Ashok K. Mishra b,";"Private on-farm investment has been lacking by smallholders in Indian agriculture. This study explores the efficiency of alternative public expenditures to support Indian agriculture and encourage private on-farm investment. Specifically, the paper examines the crowding-in effect of input subsidies and other forms of public investments on private on-farm investment. The study uses an autoregressive distributive lag model and data from 1980 to 2018. Findings reveal that irrigation subsidy strongly induces private on-farm investment over the long-run and short-run. However, public expenditures on research, education, and the area served by public canals have a significant crowding-in effect on private on-farm investment over the short and long run. Other factors that stimulate private investment in Indian agriculture include institutional credit, favorable agricultural terms of trade, and future demand for food. Thus, policymakers should better target and rationalize public expenditures programs. Policy recommendations include removing unproductive input subsidies (such as fertilizer and power subsidies) and diverting the freed resources toward public investment in Indian agriculture."
554;Magnitude and seasonal variation of N2O and CH4 emissions over a mixed agriculture-urban region;"Xin Tong a , Bert Scheeren a , Fred Bosveld c , Arjan Hensen d , Arnoud Frumau d , Harro A.J. Meijer a , Huilin Chen a,b";"Inventory estimates of N2O and CH4 emissions disregard temporal and spatial variabilities, which hinders the search for effective local strategies to lower greenhouse gas emissions. We have quantified the emissions of N2O and CH4 in a mixed agriculture-urban region using two independent approaches, i.e., the vertical gradient method (VGM) and the radon-tracer method (RTM), compared the estimated annual fluxes with the EDGARv6.0 emissions, revealed the seasonal variations of the VGM fluxes, and inferred the sources that most likely cause the seasonal variations based on the footprint analysis even though our methods cannot attribute different sources. We show that the annual RTM estimates represented by the mode of lognormal fit for N2O and CH4 are 0.4 g m- 2 yr- 1 and 12 g m- 2 yr- 1 , and the VGM estimates are 0.6 ? 0.3 g m- 2 yr- 1 and 13 ? 4 g m- 2 yr- 1 , respectively. Furthermore, the average EDGARv6.0 emissions constrained by the VGM and the RTM footprints are 1.3 g m- 2 yr- 1 and 0.9 g m- 2 yr- 1 for N2O, and 21 g m- 2 yr- 1 and 18 g m- 2 yr- 1 for CH4. Compared to our estimated fluxes, EDGARv6.0 N2O and CH4 emissions are both overestimated for N2O, it is mainly caused by an overestimation of the chemical industry?s emission. Moreover, in contrast to EDGARv6.0  s nearly constant monthly emissions throughout the year, the VGM estimates of N2O and CH4 show seasonal variations with relatively high values from March to September, which is most likely caused by agricultural activities. Our study demonstrates that large nighttime vertical gradients of atmospheric N2O and CH4 mole fractions at a tall tower can be used to derive surface fluxes by the VGM taken together with the RTM fluxes, both the annual means and the temporal variations of N2O and CH4 emissions can be constrained on a regional scale."

The aim of this paper is to better understand the utilization of solar energy resources and the sustainable development of agriculture. The results showed that the emergy yield rate in the area of study was 342.66, the emergy investment rate was 0.01, and the emergy density was 3.49 ? 1011 sej/m2 . The emergy input per capita was 2.32 ? 1016 sej/pp, and the emergy yield per capita was 8.42 ? 1016 sej/pp. This work revealed that the environment contribution rate was 98.97%, the renewable resource input rate was 97.34%, the non-renewable natural resource input rate was 1.63%, and the non-renewable industrial resource input rate was 1.03%. Besides, the study also showed that the environmental capacity was 0.027, and the environmental sustainability index was 12,691.11. The results affirmed that the agricultural economic development was relatively backward, and the sustainable development ability was weak. To advance the agricultural economy and strengthen the sustainable development ability of agriculture, it is necessary for the Shangri-La County authority to pay more attention to increasing the high-grade ability energy, adjustment of the emergy investment structure and agricultural development mode transformation."

Using the semi-arid region of Guinea as a case study, this paper is the first to discuss the primary factors driving smallholder farmers into artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) in arid and semi-arid regions. Drawing on in-depth interviews and root-cause analysis, we find that increasing climate change impacts ?force? smallholder farmers to switch into artisanal gold mining. Smallholder farming in semiarid Guinea is largely rainfed and erratic rainfall and increasing temperatures have affected crop production and farmers? income, driving many smallholder farmers into artisanal gold mining to have a more sustainable income. While artisanal gold mining has improved smallholder farmers? socioeconomic conditions, the agriculture exodus has significantly affected crop production, food prices, and rural agriculture labor dynamics. Agroecological, financial, and technical support could improve the adaptive capacity of climate impacted smallholder farmers in arid and semi-arid regions."

The recently launched Chinese GF-6 wide field-of-view camera (WFV) with a revisit cycle of 4-day and spatial resolution of 16-meter shows great potential for agricultural monitoring. In this study, Qianjiang City characterized by complex agricultural landscapes was selected as the research area to assess the potential of GF-6 data in identifying crop types. Firstly, the pairwise and global separability were calculated to analyze the effect of different spectral-temporal features of GF-6 images on crop classification. A total of 255 spectral-temporal features derived from 15 GF-6 tiles were then used to perform random forest classification. Furthermore, the classification results were evaluated based on 671 field samples and then compared the accuracy between GF-6 data and Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8 data. In addition, the earliest identifiable time of crop types was also determined by iteratively using all available GF-6 data during each time period. The results suggested that the overall accuracy (OA) of all available GF-6 images was 91.55%, which was significantly higher than that of Landsat-8 data (OA = 85.97%) and was slightly lower than that of Sentinel-2 data (OA = 93.10%). The newly added red-edge bands (0.69 ~ 0.73 ?m, 0.73 ~ 0.77 ?m) and their derivative vegetation indices were important spectral features, and the period from mid-March to earlyApril was the best temporal window for crop identification in our research area. Moreover, late July was the earliest crop identifiable time with overall accuracy of 90% for the first time of the year. These results indicated the great potential of GF-6 images for classifying crop types in the areas with complex cropping system and fragmented agricultural landscapes, particularly when integrating other satellite data with comparable spatial resolution (e.g. Chinese GF-1 data and Sentinel-2 data)."

Sophisticated techniques (i.e. modelling) have been applied in the last decades worldwide for accurate LULC classification and future projections. However, using these techniques in heterogeneous agricultural regions to extract crop-related information is still challenging. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of crop pattern prediction for the year 2050 with the CLUE-S model in an agricultural plain. The model was calibrated and validated based on the LULC changes to model future changes of the crop pattern by 2050. Twelve driving factors were utilised to quantify the relationship of LULC classes. The statistical relationship among the factors was examined with a Binomial Logistic Regression approach. Additionally, the magnitude of change in agricultural crop patterns between 2015 and 2050 was calculated according to local/regional policies and incorporated to the model as scenario layer. Future model results indicated that the cotton would increase by % 45 whereas maize would decrease by % 10 compared to 2015. The model performance was evaluated using the ground truth from the field observations considering the agricultural policies through the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) indicators. The mean ROC value for the agricultural crop patterns was calculated as 0.71, while ROC values for other LULC classes were over 0.90. Overall a 0.79 ROC value was achieved as the model accuracy"
562;Investigating the relationship between knowledge and the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices: The case of Dutch arable farmers;"Thomas Slijper a,b,* , Annika F. Tensi b , Frederic Ang b , Beshir M. Ali b , H.J. van der Fels-Klerx b,c";"The intensive usage of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides helps Dutch arable farmers to secure high yields at low costs. However, this intensive arable production system also results in environmental degradation in terms of biodiversity loss and reduced soil and water quality. Adopting sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) reduces arable farmers? reliance on fertilisers and pesticides. Therefore, SAPs contribute to enhancing farm sustainability and resilience. Despite the promising potential of SAPs, their adoption rates remain low. We investigate which combinations of SAPs are jointly adopted in portfolios and how the adoption rate of SAP portfolios can be improved. Specifically, this paper aims to explore the relationship between knowledge and the adoption of SAP portfolios. First, we investigate the SAP portfolios that are jointly adopted using Correlation Explanation. Second, we estimate a multivariate probit model to explore if SAP portfolios are complementary or substitutionary to each other. Finally, we run a partial least squares structural equation model to investigate how the level of knowledge and informal knowledge are associated with the adoption of SAP portfolios. Results show that both the level of knowledge and informal knowledge are positively related to the adoption of these SAPs that require initial investments or aim to reduce pesticide and fertiliser usage. However, we find no significant relationship between knowledge and the adoption of SAPs that are already subsidised by policymakers. We conclude that persuading farmers to adopt more SAPs requires policymakers to consider combinations of economic (e.g. subsidies) and behavioural policy interventions (e.g. facilitating peer-to-peer knowledge sharing)."

565;Agricultural landscape change impact on the quality of land: An African continent-wide assessment in gained and displaced agricultural lands;"Felicia O. Akinyemi a,b,* , Chinwe Ifejika Speranza a";"Agricultural land area is increasing globally despite the loss of productive agricultural lands in some world regions. We examine the case of Africa where the knowledge about major agricultural land transitions and the impacts on the quality of land is still very limited. A comprehensive assessment of change in agricultural landscapes was conducted at the African continental scale. We identify influencing factors and model the quality of land associated with agricultural land gains and losses between 2000 and 2018. Land quality was established based on spatially-explicit analysis of varying Net Primary Productivity, soil organic carbon content, crop suitability and percent yield change for major crops of global importance grown across Africa such as maize, rice, soybean, wheat, and alfalfa. Distance to settlements was important in explaining agricultural land dynamics. Most land areas that transitioned to cropland in Africa were associated with large distances away from major roads. Poor access to major roads suggests the remoteness of gained croplands. Land quality was better in gained croplands than in those lost, whereas gained grasslands were of lesser quality compared to areas of grassland loss. Five typologies of African countries were developed based on net yield and amount of land cultivated per crop in cropland change areas. Type 1 typifies net yield increase and cultivated land decrease, while type 2 is characterized by yield increase consequent upon cropland expansion. Net yield and land remain unchanged in type 3, while in type 4 cultivated land increased but yield decreased as in 40% of African countries for maize, and in type 5, both yield and land area decreased. This study thus provides evidence about the quality of land in gained and lost agricultural areas and generalizable insights on their dynamics across Africa."
566;Agricultural practices regulate the seasonality of groundwater-river nitrogen exchanges;"Monica Pinardi a,* , Elisa Soana b , Edoardo Severini c , Erica Racchetti c , Fulvio Celico c , Marco Bartoli c,d";"Soil System Budgets (SSB) of nutrients are generally performed annually over arable land to infer their use efficiency and water pollution risk in highly exploited agricultural watersheds. They are seldom partitioned into seasonal budgets and matched with seasonal nutrient transport in adjacent river reaches. We calculated seasonal soil nitrogen (N) budgets in a Mincio River sub-basin (Italy), and we analyzed the dissolved inorganic N net export in the river reach draining such sub-basin. Our results show seasonal differences of SSB with N excess in winter and even more in spring, equilibrium among sources and sinks during autumn and N deficit during summer. Seasonal inorganic N loads transported by the river were not correlated with SSB as they peaked in late summer and were at their minimum in early spring. Fertilization uncoupled to significant uptake supports N excess in winter and spring, whereas crop uptake uncoupled to N inputs supports summer N deficit. Nitrification cannot explain nitrate accumulation in the river reach, suggesting alternative dynamics driving the local hydrology. Flood irrigation results in large soil nitrate solubilization, transport and in upward migration of the groundwater piezometric head during spring and summer periods. River water is likely replaced by nitrate-rich groundwater when the groundwater recharge exceeds a certain threshold coinciding with late summer. Irrigation is then interrupted and the piezometric head, together with nitrate exchange, decreases. This work suggests that a deep understanding of N dynamics in agricultural watersheds with flooding irrigation on permeable soils needs the reconstruction of the vertical pathways of nitrate and of river-groundwater interactions. Moreover, the partitioning of annual into seasonal N budgets and their combination with irrigation practices allows the identification of hot moments in N cycling. Agricultural practices minimizing nitrate excess, its mobility and the risk of surface and groundwater pollution are suggested for this area."
567;The digitization of agricultural industry ? a systematic literature review on agriculture 4.0;"Rabiya Abbasi a , Pablo Martinez b , Rafiq Ahmada,";"Agriculture is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world?s population, agri-food demands are growing ? posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are significantly explored and openair farms are frequently considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities."
568;"A tutorial on data mining for Bayesian networks, with a specific focus on IoT for agriculture";"Paul J. Krause * , Vivek Bokinala";"We are seeing a steady build up in momentum of two trends that will lead to a significant, and necessary, transformation of agriculture in the 21st Century. Firstly, the move to digital with IoT facilitating the use of sensor networks to support precise decision making. Secondly, the move to ?ecological intensification? working with natural processes to lower the carbon footprint of agricultural processes and increase the biodiversity of agricultural units without sacrificing yield. Clearly data mining and machine learning have an important role to play in supporting this transformation. However, given the range of biotic, abiotic and social contexts that need to inform the development of models for decision support in agriculture, we need data mining techniques that support the use of qualitative and unstructured data as well as hard numerical data. In this tutorial we show how Bayesian Networks can be built from a wide range of sources of expert knowledge and data. Whist we use digital agriculture as a key beneficiary of these techniques, this tutorial will also be of interest to all those with an interest in building IoT systems that require combinations of social, technical and environmental understanding."
569;Dynamic variation of meteorological drought and its relationships with agricultural drought across China;"Fei Wang a , Hexin Lai a , Yanbin Li a,* , Kai Feng a , Zezhong Zhang a , Qingqing Tian a,b , Xiaomeng Zhu c , Haibo Yang d";"Under the background of climate warming, the global water cycle is gradually accelerating, which will lead to increased drought frequency and severity. China is one of the countries with the highest drought risk and the most serious drought impact, accompanied by abnormal and variable drought characteristics in recent decades. However, the dynamic variation of meteorological drought and its complicated relationships with agricultural drought are still unclear across China. In this study, the characteristics of meteorological drought were comprehensively identified across China during 1960?2019. The spatio-temporal variations and gridded trend characteristics of meteorological drought were revealed during the study period. Subsequently, the return period of meteorological drought was quantitatively determined based on copula models. Finally, the relationships between meteorological and agricultural drought were explicitly clarified. The results indicated that: (1) meteorological drought showed an increasing trend across China from 1960 to 2019, especially since the 1990s (2) the most serious meteorological drought occurred in 2011, with a minimum standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) value of ?0.81 (3) the percentage of drought area (PDA) with an increasing trend in spring, summer, autumn and winter was 85.8%, 77.4%, 97.7% and 12.9%, respectively (4) the most appropriate copula model of meteorological drought severity and duration was Frank copula and (5) the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought was longer in winter and shorter in summer, which can determine the appropriate irrigation period and predict the occurrence of agricultural drought. This study sheds new viewpoints into the identification of meteorological drought variation and its relationships with agricultural drought, which can also be applied in other areas."

However, a lack of knowledge and use of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) for safe pesticide usage among Indonesian farmers remains a problem. This study aims to investigate the gap between farmers knowledge of GAP for safe pesticide usage and their application of it. This research was conducted in 2020 in five Indonesian provinces. Primary data collection was by means of a survey, in which 298 respondents answered structured questionnaires. The survey also identified the sources of the information recorded and the respondents? experience of pesticide exposure. The analysis tools used were the Wilcoxon Signed Ranked Test and Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA). There were significant differences in the results of the first analysis. These results appear to confirm the results of further analysis using IPA, which show that a high level of knowledge does not mean that farmers will apply this knowledge in practice: this is particularly relevant to wearing gloves and masks, using tools to remove blockages, never clearing blocked nozzles by blowing into them, and disposing of empty containers properly. Nevertheless, in some cases high levels of knowledge do result in high levels of application. Cases of pesticide exposure affecting human health by causing symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and vomiting confirm that GAP for pesticide usage are not being implemented properly by some farmers. It is therefore recommended that their knowledge should be enhanced through the series of technical training programs using participatory approaches, so that farmers accumulate knowledge which will drive them to adopt GAP for safe pesticide usage."
571;"A research on promoting chemical fertiliser reduction for sustainable agriculture purposes: Evolutionary game analyses involving ?government, farmers, and consumers?";"Mengling Tian a , Yangyang Zheng a,* , Xiaolong Sun b,c , Haochi Zheng d";"The excessive use of chemical fertilisers seriously worsened the agro-ecological environment in China. Despite the Chinese government enacted a series of policies to reduce chemical fertilisers use, the situation has not been significantly improved. Existing researches about the fertiliser reduction mainly from a single subject, but farmers? chemical fertiliser use behaviour is jointly affected by multiple subjects, including farmers, market and government. To reduce chemical fertilisers use and realize the green and sustainable development of agriculture, this paper builds a tripartite evolution model of the government, farmers and consumers based on evolutionary game theory, and simulates and discusses the behaviour of the government, farmers and consumers in the process of fertiliser reduction. Results indicate: (1) Under different partnership modes, the tripartite of government, farmers and consumers can evolve to reach a stable state. (2) The government?s ecological compensation for farmers? fertiliser reduction and subsidies for consumers? green consumption are inadequate. Raising ecological compensation to 200%?267% of the original level could incentive farmers chemical fertiliser reduction. Raising the price subsidies for consumers? green consumption to approximately 136% of the original level could help motivate farmers to make a green production transformation through the market mechanism. (3) Farmers? risk expectations of fertiliser reduction is negatively correlated with farmers? chemical fertilisers reduction willingness and consumers? green consumption willingness. Consumers? trust is positively correlated with farmers? chemical fertilisers reduction willingness and consumers? green consumption willingness. This study provides theoretical guidance for the government, farmers and consumers in making scientific decisions, serving as a policy reference for the government to promote chemical fertiliser reduction."
572;A framework for promoting natural climate solutions in the agriculture sector;Lisa Ashton;"Natural climate solutions adopted by agricultural producers, such as cover crops, avoided grassland conversion, and improved nutrient management, can contribute to climate change mitigation while producing social and environmental co-benefits. Scaling natural climate solutions in agriculture is increasingly being explored as a critical component for achieving net-zero targets. There is growing recognition, however, that the hoped-for benefits of natural climate solutions will not be realized without a governance ecosystem that enables adoption. While many governance mechanisms have emerged to promote natural climate solutions in agriculture such as ecosystem service markets, climate innovation and clean tech funds, and producer education and outreach programs, little attention has been paid to how these governance mechanisms effectively contribute to an enabling governance ecosystem and where they fit within. In response, this paper compiles and synthesizes recommendations from relevant research fields including natural climate solutions, agri-environmental stewardship, and environmental governance to formulate a framework for natural climate solutions in agriculture. The framework manifests as a list of ten normative criteria organized by macro, sector, and geographical scales, which, if realized, can be expected to scale natural climate solutions adoption in agriculture. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, it is used to evaluate efforts to promote natural climate solutions in Canada?s agriculture sector. This evaluation reveals an approach that is progressing towards meeting the criteria of the framework. However, in its current state, the governance ecosystem that influences natural climate solutions adoption in Canada?s agriculture sector is project specific, with a patchwork of governance mechanisms largely operating parallel to one another, such that only some regional successes are possible. The framework is a starting point for identifying what might define an enabling governance ecosystem for natural climate solutions adoption in agriculture based on literature, highlighting the opportunity for future empirical research to build upon this framework towards a more complete view."

McGrath b , Keith F. Joiner d , Hussein Abbass a";"Sky Shepherding is a concept whereby moving tasks are performed by an autonomous airborne agent capable of responding to animal behaviour and improving animal welfare outcomes. To achieve this outcome, a series of experiments investigated the potential welfare impacts of using a purpose-built Sky Shepherd compared to a trained sheepdog. Data was collected using a bespoke system of mobile phones, heart-rate sensors, and edge computing devices. In this article, we present the findings of the experiments, specifically that a Sky Shepherd has the potential to foster improved animal welfare on farms but does not significantly reduce the physiological stress of Merino sheep during mustering. We outline the system requirements developed to build a Sky Shepherd and supporting sensor network and the future directions to support improved performance. Finally, we present the potential challenges to using high data-rate transfer systems in remote areas and possible future mitigations to support autonomous muster capabilities."

575;"Comprehensive evaluation of the water-energy-food nexus in the agricultural management of the Tarim River Basin, Northwest China";"Meiqing Feng a,b , Yaning Chen b,* , Weili Duan b , Gonghuan Fang b , Zhi li b , Li Jiao a,e , Fan Sun b,c , Yupeng Li b , Yifeng Hou b,d";"The water-energy-food nexus index in the agricultural management of the Tarim River Basin (TRB) is an important index that reflects agricultural inputs productivity. This study used the crop water requirement, energy equivalent, and agricultural water-energy-food nexus index (WEFNI) model to comprehensively evaluate the water and energy consumption, water and energy productivity, and the WEFNI of the main crops (rice, wheat, maize and cotton) in the TRB from 1990 to 2019. The results indicated that different crops had significant differences in water and energy consumption. The blue water requirements of wheat, maize, rice, and cotton were 3174.9 m3 ha- 1 yr- 1 , 4271.8 m3 ha- 1 yr- 1 , 7283.3 m3 ha- 1 yr- 1 and 8769.3 m3 ha- 1 yr- 1 , respectively. Of these crops, wheat had the lowest blue water requirements and cotton had the highest. In addition, the planting area of the TRB increased by 105 ? 104 ha during the study period, with cotton accounting for 45% of the total planting area. The expansion of the planting area led to a continuous improvement in cotton production income, leading to the highest energy economic productivity in cotton (0.065 $/MJ). However, the increase in total water and energy consumption, water and energy mass productivity in cotton were lower than in the other three crops (0.15 kg/m3 and 0.04 kg/MJ). The average WEFNI of rice, wheat, maize and cotton was 0.40, 0.45, 0.43 and 0.35, respectively. This demonstrated that wheat had the highest resources utilization productivity in agricultural inputs, while cotton had the lowest. These results can provide an important scientific basis for current and future agricultural management optimization."
576;A review of Best Management Practices for potato crop using Precision Agricultural Technologies;"Uzair Ahmad * , Lakesh Sharma";"Precision agricultural technologies (PATs) have revolutionized the way farmers grow crops, including potatoes. This review paper presented an overview of the best management practices (BMPs) such as soil preparation, proper irrigation, crop fertilization, pest and disease management, and harvest and storage of potato crop using PATs. The paper evaluated the economic and environmental aspects of the BMPs in five major research engines, such as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Sciences, and IEEEXplore. The paper discussed the challenges faced by potato farmers in terms of increasing yields, improving quality and reducing production costs. The use of PATs, such as yield monitoring systems, precision planting, variable rate application of inputs, and remote sensing among others, is discussed as a solution to these challenges. The paper summarized the current state of the art in these technologies and provided a comprehensive review of the existing literature. The review highlighted the benefits of using PATs in potato crop management, including increased yields, improved efficiency, and reduced environmental impact. The review paper provided recommendations for gaps and limitations in BMPs using PATs. The paper concluded by providing suggestions for future research in this area, including the need for more interdisciplinary studies and the development of new PATs."

Among such strategies, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and multifaceted mechanisms of action are recognized as ideal alternatives in the post-antibiotic era. In particular, AMPs derived from microbes with active metabolisms that can adapt to a variety of extreme environments have long been sought after. Consequently, this review summarizes information on naturally occurring AMPs, including their biological activity, antimicrobial mechanisms, and the preparation of microbial-derived AMPs it also outlines their applications and the challenges presented by their use in the agroindustry. By dissecting the research results on microbial-derived AMPs of previous generations, this study contributes valuable knowledge on the exploration and realization of the applications of AMPs in sustainable agriculture."
578;Emergy evaluation of positive and negative benefits of agricultural water use based on energy analysis of water cycle;"Meiyan Gao a , Zening Wu a , Xi Guo a,* , Denghua Yan b";"The current assessment of the positive and negative benefits of agricultural water use lacks a depiction of the overall internal energy flow, which lead to the identification and analysis of agricultural water use benefits are not comprehensive enough. Based on the ?water supply - water use and consumption - drainage - pollutant carrying? link in the ecological economic system of agricultural water resources, the energy conversion relationship of each link were analyzed, and the main connotation and composition of the positive and negative benefits of agricultural water use were raised, then a set of emergy quantitative method system of the positive and negative benefits of agricultural water use was built. Taking Zhengzhou city as an example, the positive and negative benefits of agricultural water use in 2017 were calculated. The research results show that the negative benefits of agricultural water resources eco-economic system production account for 37.93% of the positive benefits. The main reason for the negative benefits is non-point source pollution caused by TN, TP and COD. Consequently, developing production and social policies to limit the amount of non-point source pollution caused by pollutants in agricultural production is an effective way to increase the efficiency of agricultural water production while reducing the negative benefits generated."
579;Determining the ecological compensation standards based on willingness to accept (WTA) for intensive agricultural production areas: A case in China;"Zhonghao Zhang a , Yanzhi Cui b , Lei Wang c , Ximan Sun a , Yang Gao c,d,";"Ecological compensation is an effective way to encourage farmers to use minimal chemical fertilizers by paying for their losses when agricultural planting methods change. In this research, we conducted field surveys and created a conceptual framework to determine the compensation standard based on farmers? willingness to accept (WTA) and ecosystem service values in a rotational double cropping area of winter wheat?summer maize, Huantai County, China. The results showed that the farmers? average WTA on the chemical fertilizer reduction application fluctuates within a range of 250.00?7740.00 CNY/hm2 . The limiting compensation standards range from 362.74 to 4823.43 CNY/hm2 and the ceiling standard is from 367.29 to 4851.83 CNY/hm2 by reducing chemical fertilizer application from 5% to 95%. Huantai County has a potential of 15%?35% for chemical fertilizer reduction, and the compensation standard is the lowest (362.74 CNY/hm2 ) when 25% of the current chemical fertilizer usage is reduced. Our research provided a valid approach to determining ecological compensation standards toward the aims of efficiency and sustainability for protecting farmland ecology and highlighting the critical ecosystem service changes caused by the farmland fertilizer reduction program in China."

581;Residential and agricultural soils dominate soil organic matter loss in a typical agricultural watershed of subtropical China;"Xuan Chen a , Xiaobo Qin a,* , Yong Li b , Yunfan Wan a , Yulin Liao c , Yanhong Lu c , Bin Wang a , Hongru Chen a , Kaiyue Wang a";"Soil organic matter (SOM) loss in agricultural watersheds driven by hydrology threatens the aquatic environment, and increases the risk of greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic systems, and will be detrimental to both the green development of agriculture and the achievement of the national ?carbon peaking and carbon neutrality? goal of China. Consequently, we explored the use of d13C, d15N, and the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) as end-members and combined this with a Bayesian stable-isotope mixed model to quantitatively estimate the contribution of typical land-use types (i.e., forest, rice, vegetable, tea, and residential soils) to sedimentary organic matter in a typical agricultural watershed in subtropical China. The results indicated that there was significant spatial variation of d13C, d15N, and the C/N in the target sediment mixture and its sources. The range of sediment d13C (- 26.2? to - 23.8?) and d15N (3.9?7.9?) were within the ranges of the sources, with d13C and d15N ranges of - 29.3? to - 20? and - 1.2? to 9?, respectively. The average C/N of sediment was 11.1 ? 0.52, which was significantly higher than all source samples. The spatial distribution of d13C and d15N indicated that SOM loss in this catchment may primarily be attributed to vegetable and residential soils. According to the qualitative identification from dual fingerprint mark composite graphs of the C/N and d15N, as well as d13C and d15N, the sedimentary SOM in the Tuojia watershed was mainly derived from sewage. Furthermore, Bayesian stable-isotope mixed model analysis indicated that residential soil was the main contributor to the SOM loss in the watershed, with a contribution rate of 75.8 %, followed by agricultural land (rice and vegetable soils) with a combined input of 12 %. The findings highlight that anthropogenic life and agricultural production have a vital impact on the carbon and nitrogen cycle in this agricultural catchment, and improving the rural habitation environment may play a key role in the control of SOM loss in subtropical agricultural watersheds."
582;Risk assessment for uptake and accumulation of pharmaceuticals by baby leaf lettuce irrigated with reclaimed water under commercial agricultural activities;"L. Ponce-Robles * , L. Benelhadj, A.J. Garc?-Garc?, F. Pedrero-Salcedo, P.A. Nortes-Tortosa, J. Albacete, J.J. Alarcon";"The use of reclaimed water to irrigate agricultural crops has increased in recent years as a consequence of water shortage constituting a potential risk for human health. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact on the soil-plant system and determining the accumulation of carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), ketoprofen (KTP) and naproxen (NPX) in the edible part of lettuce under commonly used agricultural practices in commercial production. For this purpose, red oak baby lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) was irrigated with reclaimed water fortified with different concentrations of pharmaceuticals. The study was carried out in two different scenarios: soil and tray. The tray experiments were conducted with substrate and took place at three different seasons of the year. Lettuce tissue sampled from these experiments were analysed 3 times during the lettuce growing cycle (first, second and third harvest). The practices of first harvest regrowth were also evaluated. For all experiments, CBZ showed the highest accumulation in lettuce leaves of the pharmaceuticals tested, showing a correlation between irrigation exposure time and pharmaceutical uptake. Unexpectedly, DCF was the compound with the highest uptake levels after regrowth practices. Results suggested that pharmaceuticals uptake could be directly associated with the irrigation method and possible accumulation in soil and substrates, while concentration of pharmaceuticals in substrates were 10 times higher. Based on the concentration values detected in lettuce leaves, the risk assessment suggests that no compounds imply any risk to human health, except CBZ for those on vegetarian diets in the tray scenario. Although commercial agricultural practices are usually not considered with regards to risk reduction, in this experiment we demonstrated that climatic conditions are a key factor in pharmaceuticals uptake and different agricultural practices (soil cropping and drip irrigation) can limit the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in crops."

A scoping review conducted under a protocol aligned to the internationally accepted PRISMA- ScR found that most studies are focused on the provision of digital advisory and extension services to farmers, and they reported outcomes associated mainly with ?practice change? and ?increased knowledge.? While many studies focused on on-farm agronomy, either through digital advisory or precision agriculture tools, they lacked data about outcomes related to environmental sustainability and climate resilience. This review also found that use facilitators and barriers should also be considered when studying and reporting on the uptake of services and their outcomes."
585;Intertwining innovation and business networks for sustainable agricultural systems: A case study of carbon-neutral beef;"Joao Mota, Jose Novais Santos * , Raissa Alencar";"Increasing concerns about climate change and sustainability have been a major challenge for corporations and governments, translating into initiatives to help reduce the environmental impact of economic activities. Innovation networks involving several actors have promoted the adoption of sustainable practices in a deliberate and concerted manner. From a network perspective, initiatives promoted by an innovation network must be incorporated into the existing business network. This study aims to understand how and to what extent innovation and business networks are intertwined to foster sustainable practices in agricultural systems. Therefore, a study of the Carbon Neutral Beef initiative was conducted, which resulted in the development and adoption of standards that ensure carbon balance by integrating livestock and forest production systems. This study supports the notion that the viability of initiatives promoted by an innovation network depends on its overlap with the existing business network. Additionally, the intertwining process may differ in the degree to which it is controlled, thus influencing the exploration and dissemination of integrated practices involving livestock and forest production systems."

Macrae a,";"Nutrient losses from agricultural fields are the largest sources of phosphorus (P) entering the Great Lakes in North America. Stacked conservation practices (CPs) may reduce P losses from individual fields. Simple low-cost, low disturbance, commercially available filters containing wood chips and phosphorus sorbing materials (PSM) were installed on two fields already using conservation practices in midwestern Ontario (ILD and LON) to quantify their ability to remove soluble reactive P (SRP), particulate P (PP), total P (TP) and total suspended sediments (TSS) from surface runoff. Laboratory tests on unused (new) and used (field) filter materials were also conducted to estimate P sorption and remobilization potentials. During the two-year study period, the filter retained 0.018 kg ha-1 of SRP, 0.38 kg ha-1 of PP, 0.4 kg ha-1 of TP and 8.75 kg ha-1 of TSS from surface runoff at the ILD site. In contrast, although the filter at LON removed 37 kg ha-1 of TSS and 0.07 kg ha-1 of PP, it released 0.22 kg ha-1 of SRP and 0.15 kg ha-1 TP. A reduction in filter efficacy was observed over time, particularly at the site with greater cumulative surface runoff and larger runoff events (LON). The majority of the SRP retained by the filter was held in a loosely bound form, thus, susceptible to P remobilization. The results of this study demonstrate that low-cost, simple PSMs have some potential to retain P from surface runoff, but their efficacy may decline over time and their P retention capability may differ with site hydrology (e.g., runoff volumes and velocity) and P supply."
587;Investigating the performance of agricultural sector on well-being: New evidence from Burkina Faso;"Ousmane Traore a , Chang Wei b,? , Abdul Rehman c,";"Burkina Faso?s economy is based mostly on agriculture. Despite this sector?s substantial contribution to economic development, the majority of the population continues to live below the poverty line, and poverty is even more pronounced in rural areas where subsistence farming is the main source of income. The present research intends to assess the effects of the agriculture sector on the wellbeing of society in Burkina Faso from 1970 to 2017 using a Vector Autoregressive technique. The results reveal that agriculture sector has an adverse influence on well-being in both short- and long-run when household consumption expenditure (HCE) used as a proxy of well-being. While this sector uncovered a productive impact on well-being measured by education (EDU) in both short- and long-run. An increase in the agriculture value-added induces an extend in the short-run and a reduction in the long-run of life expectancy (LEXP) in the Burkina Faso. The variance decomposition results show that the agricultural sector will contribute about 57.33% to explain variation in the household final consumption expenditure while industry and service sectors will only contribute about 2.03% and 4.42% respectively. However, the value-added from the industrial sector affects significantly (47.37%) the variation of life expectancy at birth in Burkina Faso. In addition, Granger?s causality test has demonstrated a unidirectional causal impact from agriculture value-added to household income. The same causal links were also discovered, respectively from the agricultural and service sectors to life expectancy. This study emphasizes the necessity to concentrate stakeholders including farmers, policymakers and experts on agri-business strategies and programs, investment in farm commodity processing in the growing country concerned. The farmers may thus change from subsistence to agri-business, therefore accelerating the industry?s growth and creating more jobs for the working population and diversifying the country?s household income sources"

Lawes a";"Machine learning (ML) and its branch, deep learning (DL), is rapidly evolving and gaining popularity as it outperforms other, more traditional methods in different areas of agriculture. However, ML and DL techniques must be correctly applied to a problem to produce an acceptable solution. This article provides guidelines for using DL techniques with a case study using different models/methods to forecast yields in cereals some of the concepts presented here are also applicable to ML more broadly. The objective is to provide clarity for new users around the use of DL techniques to solve agronomic problems. DL concepts are introduced best practices for data pre-processing steps and metrics are recommended. Cross-validation is clarified, and its importance is highlighted. It is shown that DL performance can vary with architecture and that the optimal choice is taskdependent. Emphasis on practical aspects for applying DL models for agricultural datasets is provided, such as dataset size (26 representative samples in each field sufficed) and cross-validation (indispensable on small datasets). Lastly, a standard guideline for DL applied to tabular data is recommended."
589;The possibilities and limits of trade secrets to protect data shared between firms in agricultural and food sectors;"Alfred Radauer a,* , Nicola Searle b , Martin A. Bader c";"Both public policy and business management are increasingly interested in how to manage trade secrets. One of the driving forces is the growing significance of data as an asset, as ?oil of the 21st century?. Trade secrets are often seen as the major Intellectual Property (IP) tool for protecting data. There is also the understanding that the need to share data is increasing to allow for new types of innovation. This paper seeks to understand how data sharing practices and the use of trade secrets are evolving in the agricultural industries. Using explorative empirical data from four in-depth case studies, the paper develops a framework for data sharing practices, value sharing, and trade secrets use. We find that current data sharing practices pool around two scenarios, where data is not shared or shared only with limited partners (hence closed) and there are differences whether value created from the data is shared. We conclude that a nuanced view on the use of trade secrets in data sharing is mandated for both IP/data managers and scholars analysing the topic."
590;Soil suitability classification for crop selection in precision agriculture using GBRT-based hybrid DNN surrogate models;"Showkat Ahmad Bhat a,* , Imtiyaz Hussain b,* , Nen-Fu Huang c";"The main reason for agricultural productivity decline is farmers failure to choose the appropriate crop for their soil. It is important for farmers to understand which crops are suitable for different soil types based on their characteristics. Due to the vast variety of soil types worldwide, farmers often struggle to choose the most profitable crop for their land. To improve crop yields, a crop selection system has been developed using GBRTbased deep learning surrogate models. Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT) has been combined with a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to determine the most optimal hyperparameters for the deep neural network. The optimized hyperparameters are then applied during the testing phase. Further, the impact of each input parameter on the individual outputs is evaluated using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The crop recommendation system comprises data preparation, classification, and performance evaluation modules. A classification method based on confusion matrices and performance matrices, as well as feature analysis using density plots and correlation plots, follows. The crop selection system categorizes the experimental dataset into 12 classes, with three for each of the four crops. The dataset includes soil-specific physical and chemical features such as sand, silt, clay, pH, electric conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). The developed surrogate model is highly accurate, precise, and reliable, with an F1-Score of 1.0 for all classes in the dataset, indicating exact accuracy and recall. The DNN-based classification model achieves an average classification accuracy of 1.00."
591;Soil biogeochemistry and the global agricultural footprint;Ronald Amundson;"21st Century soil science must deeply grapple with the enormity of the agricultural impact on soils, and the complex ways in which this impacts soil sustainability. The first step is to remove the cloud of mysticism that sometimes surrounds soil and farming, reframe the narrative, and be clear about the enormous difficulty of creating a truly steady state and/or C-neutral soil management system. The objective of this paper is to examine the global footprint of agriculture on soils, and its impact on soil erosion, carbon, and nutrients. Stabilizing any one of these 3 mass balances globally will require complex and highly integrated collaborations between social scientists, policy experts, engineers, farmers, politicians, and natural scientists. There are no magical or simple solutions. Yet, there are untapped opportunities for research and solution-driven activities that can help to create a new framework for more effective efforts by our science to address wicked societal problems."
592;Real-time kinematics applied at unmanned aerial vehicles positioning for orthophotography in precision agriculture;"JosuGonz?ez-Garc?, Rick L. Swenson, Alfonso G?ez-Espinosa?";"In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained attention in the agricultural field, particularly in what is known as Precision Agriculture (PA). The use of these vehicles responds to the need for optimizing resources to have greater yields while reducing the negative impact on the environment. One of the main functions for UAVs in this field is the Remote Sensing (RS) of the crops. A UAV can fly over a large area to capture images that can be merged into an ortho-rectified photo mosaic, or orthomosaic. One of the main problems for that is to get the orthomosaic accurately georeferenced, which could be critical for decision making or to implement precise preventive/corrective actions in the crops. An accurate georeferenced orthomosaic can be obtained either by direct or indirect methods. Whereas indirect methods have been extensively studied before, there are few results reported in the literature for direct methods. In this work, the accuracy of an orthomosaic direct georeferenced using Real-Time Kinematics (RTK) applied during the UAV flight was evaluated. The aim was to obtain accurately referenced orthomosaics that could be used in the future by other autonomous vehicles. Results shown a reduction in the positioning error of up to 98% when compared with direct GPS georeferencing."
593;Drought and intensified agriculture enhanced vegetation growth in the central Pearl River Basin of China;"Wenhuan Huang a,b,c , Hailong Wang a,b,c,";"Plant-water relation is one of the key focus of Ecohydrology, and it usually presents specific characteristics varying with climate, species and soils based on field studies. The large-scale plant-water relations in the Pearl River Basin were previously analysed and the hotspot for water and vegetation changes was identified in the cropland-dominated region. Here, we focused in this region and analysed how intensive agriculture could have modified or been affected by water resources in response to droughts. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the monthly vegetation change was more likely subject to energy availability while the annual change was mainly affected by precipitation and water storage. This cropland area experienced fairly frequent mild droughts, and the trend of a drought index SPEI showed a clear difference from that in the non-agricultural areas, particularly in growing seasons. Further examination showed that SPEI, vegetation parameters and agricultural data had strong positive relationships vegetation parameters and water use varied significantly and positively with the planting structure and intensification of agricultural activities like fertilization and irrigation (r > 0.6, p < 0.05). A positive influence of droughts on crop production was detected, i.e. the mild droughts can promote productivity probably through firstly enhanced photosynthesis induced by enhanced solar exposure and secondly increased supplementary water supply by irrigation under drought. This study strengthens our understanding of the agriculture-water interactions in the humid subtropical region and has implications for agricultural water management and drought impact mitigations."
594;Relating risk preferences and risk perceptions over different agricultural risk domains: Insights from Ethiopia;"Ashenafi Duguma Feyisa a,b , Miet Maertens a , Yann de Mey c,";"Households in developing countries are exposed to various shocks and risks, which leaves them vulnerable as they typically have limited resources to cope with them. Even though a large body of development literature has focused on the role of risk in rural livelihoods, the focus is often on single sources of risk and taking a unidimensional view on risk preference. This paper explores the diversity in risk perception and risk preferences of Ethiopian households by combining incentivized field experiments with detailed primary household survey data. We disentangle the relationship between risk perception and risk preferences using an innovative combination of time framing and instrumental variable estimation approaches. We find that our respondents are exposed to multiple past shocks and perceive multiple sources of future threats across different agricultural risk domains. Our respondents can be characterized as relatively risk-averse and loss-averse, and they also overweight unlikely extreme outcomes. We find a statistically significant association between the prospect theory risk preferences parameters?risk aversion, loss aversion, and probability weighting?and overall risk perception, domain-specific risk perceptions (except for the personal domain) and the impact dimension of future risk. Our findings make an important contribution to our understanding of farm households? risk behavior, and can guide prioritizing development efforts to stimulate better informed and well-targeted risk management policy interventions."
595;"Analysis of rainfall and temperature variability for agricultural water management in the upper Genale river basin, Ethiopia";"Mehari Shigutea,b , Tena Alamirewa,c , Adane Abebe d, Christopher E. Ndehedehee,f,* , Habtamu Tilahun Kassahune";"A better understanding of climate-induced changes and support for adaptation strategies requires knowledged of the spatiotemporal dynamics of climatic variables. This study aims to assess long-term changes in annual and seasonal rainfall and temperature for agricultural water management in the upper Genale river basin, Ethiopia. To achieve this objective, long-term climate data from 13 stations between 1975 and 2018, as well as maximum and minimum temperatures for six stations were collected from the Ethiopian National Meteorological Service Agency (NMA). The characteristics of rainfall (onset, cessation, length of growing season, and crop water requirement) were assessed using the Coefficient of Variation (CV), Standard Rainfall Anomaly (SRA), and Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI). Additionally, the Mann?Kendall test and Sen?s slope estimator were used to assess the trend and magnitude of changes in rainfall and temperature. The annual, winter, spring, summer and autumn CVs were 20%, 89%, 30%, 45%, and 32%, respectively. The standardized anomalies of annual and seasonal rainfall for the climate stations indicated that the basin had a drier season than a wet season. The mean length of the growing season in Belg and Kiremt ranged from 43 to 79 days and 38 to 170 days, respectively. On an annual, summer, and autumn season basis, most rainfall stations showed a non-significant trend. In contrast, in the spring season, rainfall showed a decreasing but statistically insignificant trend in all stations except Bensadaye, Bore, Telamokentise, and Yirba Muda stations. According to the analysis of the crop water requirements in the studied basin, supplemental irrigation is essential to reducing yield reduction and crop failure during spring and autumn. In these seasons, maize and sorghum varieties required supplementary irrigation up to 202 mm and 252 mm, respectively. Annual and seasonal maximum and minimum temperatures showed an increasing trend at all the stations except Hagre Selam station. Generally, there was a spatially and temporally variable trend in rainfall while the temperature trend was increasing irrespective of the temporal and spatial factors. Thus, this study contributes to a better understanding of climate change in the basin and these findings can be used in planning for adaptation measures against a changing climate."
596;Temporal stability analysis evaluates soil water sustainability of different cropping systems in a dryland agricultural ecosystem;"Yuanhong Zhang a,b,1 , Haoyu Li a,b,1 , Yuanguang Sun a,b , Qi Zhang a,b , Pengzhao Liu a,b , Rui Wang a,b,* , Jun Li a,b";"The Loess Plateau is a typical dryland agricultural region where water shortages are the primary limiting factor for crop production. Deep soil moisture plays a crucial role in the regulation of seasonal water shortages, however, the distribution of soil water and its temporal variation in the deep soil profile (i.e., below 2.0 m) are usually unknown in a dryland agricultural field. A field study of three cropping systems (i.e., WWC, continuous winter wheat SMC, continuous spring-maize and WMR, a rotation of winter wheat and spring maize) and three tillage practices (i.e., NT, no tillage ST, subsoiling tillage and CT, conventional tillage) was carried out in a semiarid region, and the crop yield, vertical distribution patterns and temporal variability of the soil moisture in a 5.0 m soil profile were studied to evaluate the effect of the various management strategies on the soil water sustainability. The results indicated that the WMR and SMC systems combined with ST practice obtained higher crop yield and water use efficiency, compared to the WWC system. And the time-averaged soil moisture for the three cropping systems differed significantly (P < 0.05). The WWC system can utilize soil water below 2.0 m and caused greater soil water depletion in the 0?5.0 m soil layer. However, no significant differences in the soil water content were found among the different tillage practices. The top soil layer showed a higher index of temporal stability (ITS) value for all cropping systems, but the ITS increased with soil depth in the deep soil profile (below 3.0 m) with the WWC system. Ultimately, the most time-stable depth (MTSD) for estimating the mean soil moisture of the profile was determined to be the 2.0?3.0 soil layer for all three systems based on the ITS values, but the mechanism by which the MTSD was formed differed for the various cropping systems. The soil moisture at the MTSD under WMR and SMC had high temporal stability, and contributed to better soil water sustainability in a dryland agricultural field. These findings may provide helpful base references for evaluating the effect of different management strategies on the soil water and the temporal stability parameters of soil moisture, as well as their impact on the sustainability of the deep soil moisture in a dryland agricultural field."
597;The effect of semi-natural habitat types on epigaeic arthropods: Isolate habitats make critical contribution to biodiversity in agricultural landscape;"Xiaoyu Guo a,b,c , Zhenxing Bian a,b,* , Jun Zhou d , Shuai Wang a,b , Wei Zhou a,b";"Semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes vary greatly in shape and vegetation characteristics. They can appear either as relatively large patches of several hectares or as narrow bands (less than 1 m wide) between fields and roads and between fields. Semi-natural habitats support biodiversity and associated ecosystem services on farmland, thereby contributing to sustainable agriculture. However, the effects of different semi-natural habitat types on the polytrophic level of epigaeic arthropods are still unclear. In this study, we classified semi-natural habitats into five types. (1) woody areal (WA), (2) woody line (WL), (3) herbaceous areal (HA), (4) herbaceous line (HL) and (5) isolate habitat (IH). We aimed to explore differences in epigaeic arthropod community composition in five different semi-natural habitats and the effects of different semi-natural habitats and different sampling locations on epigaeic arthropod activity-density and diversity. The results showed that epigaeic arthropod communities show significant differences, not only between farmland and semi-natural habitats, but also between different types of semi-natural habitats. Isolate habitats have the highest activity-density of epigaeic arthropods and Linear herbaceous maintain the highest epigaeic arthropod diversity. We also found in this study, both the activity-density and diversity of epigaeic arthropods showed edge-biased distribution. It may be possible to promote sustainable agricultural ecosystems by understanding the effect of semi-natural habitats on epigaeic arthropods, which is conducive to improving the quality of the agricultural ecological environment."

Based on the CFPS2018 survey data, this study suggests that farm machinery is beneficial for expanding the scale of farms. With increases in household-owned machinery, farmers are more inclined to lease-in land, and they are less inclined to rent-out land. The more agricultural machinery services farmers purchase, the more they tend to transfer-in land and the probability of transfer-out land is lower. However, uneven village terrain can weaken the effects of the two kinds of agricultural mechanization on land leasing. Moreover, this study confirms that household-owned farm machinery and outsourced agricultural machinery services could positively regulate each other?s influence on land leasing, indicating that there is a complementary relationship between the two types of agricultural machinery. Further mechanism analyses show that the channels by which household-owned farm machinery and outsourced agricultural machinery services affect land leasing are quite different. The self-purchased machinery of farmers mainly plays a role through labor complementarity effects, while outsourced agricultural machinery services mainly affect land leasing through labor substitution effects."

Adekoya a,b,* , Gbenga E. Ajayi c , Muhammad Suhrab d , Johnson A. Oliyide a";"Although the literature is being increasingly flooded with studies on the determinants of environmental degradation, the peculiarities of some countries in some regions have been substantially overlooked. Yet, these unique peculiarities either instigate or hinder some factors which matter for environmental quality. This study therefore puts the resource richness of African countries into consideration in the examination of the impacts of resources rents, agriculture, growth, and renewable energy consumption on environmental degradation. Additionally, the influence of institutional quality is uniquely examined in the nexus. The baseline model reveals that environmental degradation is respectively reduced and worsened by renewable energy consumption and growth in both the short- and the long-run. The impacts of agriculture and resources rents vary across the periods, although they both raise the level of environmental degradation. Considering the moderating role of institutional quality, its influence is stronger in the long-run. It reverses the favourable influence of renewable energy, but strengthens the adverse impact of growth. Also, it aids the ability of agriculture and resources rents to reduce degradation. Finally, the threshold results show that the impacts of the indicators on environmental degradation are sensitive to institutional quality levels. Improved institutional quality only changes the size of the impacts of renewable energy use and growth. However, contrary to poor institutional quality, an improved institution results in the ability of agriculture to reduce degradation and militates against the adverse impact of resources rents."

Ricketts a,b , Kimberly F. Wallin f , Gillian L.

However, the use of tarps has uncertain effects on soil arthropod communities. We studied the impact of silage (black plastic) tarps and clear plastic tarps on surface-active and soil-dwelling arthropods by tracking immediate impacts and arthropod recovery for 5 weeks after tarps were removed. We also assessed how well environmental and experimental variables explained arthropod diversity and composition. During tarp application, we found that both silage and clear plastic tarps had significant negative impacts on surface-active arthropod diversity, while only clear plastic tarps impacted soil-dwelling arthropods. Surfaceactive arthropod diversity recovered by 1 weeks after tarping, but at 5 weeks after tarping soil-dwelling arthropod diversity was significantly lower in silage tarp and clear plastic plots than control plots. Tarps also led to compositional changes in the arthropod communities, though these changes were only significant during tarp cover. The variables that best explained arthropod diversity and community composition were treatment (i. e., silage tarp, clear plastic tarp, or control) and farm site. Other variables, such as soil moisture and weed coverage, were not consistently strong model predictors. These results imply that tarps may have temporary impacts on surface-active arthropods but potentially longer-lasting impacts on soil-dwelling arthropods. Continuing to monitor impacts of tarps on soil arthropods will better inform the sustainability of this practice."
607;Assessment of imidacloprid removal from agricultural runoff by the bioretention treatment train system;"Nor Amirah Ahmad Zubairi a,* , Husna Takaijudin a , Aminuddin Ab Ghani b , Hui Weng Goh b , Wa Aung Day c";"Imidacloprid pesticide is commonly used in the agricultural sector to protect from pest attacks and avoid crop losses. However, the leak of Imidacloprid to the environmental system could result in dire consequences to the aquatic life and humans as the toxic contaminant produced by this pesticide may disturb the ecosystem through the pesticide cycle, which could penetrate the soil and pollute the water body especially runoff. Therefore, this paper explains the new implementation in managing pesticide pollution that occurred in the agricultural runoff, specifically Imidacloprid pesticide. The assessment was conducted by introducing a treatment train system that focuses on a few removal mechanisms. The system included a series of bioretention columns that are expected to remove Imidacloprid through infiltration, plant uptake, and pesticide degradation. The system was also designed to have different configurations in order to analyze whether various additives and plants may affect the ability of treatment train in removing Imidacloprid. Hibiscus and Ti plants were used in the bioretention columns, while coconut husk and rice husk ash were used as additives. In addition, Imidacloprid that was present in all samples was analyzed using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Ultraviolet (HPLC-UV). The removal efficiency for every configuration was recorded based on Imidacloprid concentration in influent and effluent at every column in the treatment train system. The results indicated that the vegetation set achieved 90% of Imidacloprid removal efficiency while the control set (only soil media) removed Imidacloprid at a range between 64.9 to 65.9%. Furthermore, the vegetation set with additives also resulted in the increment of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) with about 16% and pH increment between 2 to 11% for all treatment train sets with a better water quality improvement."
608;Temporal Sequence Object-based CNN (TS-OCNN) for crop classification from fine resolution remote sensing image time-series;"Huapeng Li a,? , Yajun Tian a , Ce Zhang b,? , Shuqing Zhang a , Peter M. Atkinson c";"Accurate crop distribution mapping is required for crop yield prediction and field management. Due to rapid progress in remote sensing technology, fine spatial resolution (FSR) remotely sensed imagery now offers great opportunities for mapping crop types in great detail. However, within-class variance can hamper attempts to discriminate crop classes at fine resolutions. Multi-temporal FSR remotely sensed imagery provides a means of increasing crop classification from FSR imagery, although current methods do not exploit the available information fully. In this research, a novel Temporal Sequence Object-based Convolutional Neural Network (TS-OCNN) was proposed to classify agricultural crop type from FSR image time-series. An object-based CNN (OCNN) model was adopted in the TS-OCNN to classify images at the object level (i.e., segmented objects or crop parcels), thus, maintaining the precise boundary information of crop parcels. The combination of image time-series was first utilized as the input to the OCNN model to produce an ?original? or baseline classification. Then the single-date images were fed automatically into the deep learning model scene-by-scene in order of image acquisition date to increase successively the crop classification accuracy. By doing so, the joint information in the FSR multi-temporal observations and the unique individual information from the single-date images were exploited comprehensively for crop classification. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was investigated using multitemporal SAR and optical imagery, respectively, over two heterogeneous agricultural areas. The experimental results demonstrated that the newly proposed TS-OCNN approach consistently increased crop classification accuracy, and achieved the greatest accuracies (82.68% and 87.40%) in comparison with state-of-the-art benchmark methods, including the object-based CNN (OCNN) (81.63% and 85.88%), object-based image analysis (OBIA) (78.21% and 84.83%), and standard pixel-wise CNN (79.18% and 82.90%). The proposed approach is the first known attempt to explore simultaneously the joint information from image time-series with the unique information from single-date images for crop classification using a deep learning framework. The TS-OCNN, therefore, represents a new approach for agricultural landscape classification from multi-temporal FSR imagery. Besides, it is readily generalizable to other landscapes (e.g., forest landscapes), with a wide application prospect"

Deep learning has shown promise in identifying plant diseases from leaf images, including those in paddy crops. However, the presence of slight variations among different types of paddy diseases poses a significant generalizability challenge. In this study, for the first time, we introduce a lesion-aware visual transformer for accurate and reliable detection of paddy leaf diseases through identifying discriminatory lesion features. A Novel multiscale contextual feature extraction network is presented to enable capturing a contextual local and global representation of disease features at different scales and channels. Then, a weakly supervised Paddy Lesion Localization (PLL) unit was presented to locate distinctive lesions in paddy leaves that provide the model with discriminative leaf regions that can guide the final classification decision. A feature tuning unit is presented to empower modeling the relations within the global and local latent spaces, thereby improving the spatial exchanges between visual semantics of paddy leaves. The exhaustive experimental comparison against state-of-theart solutions on public paddy disease datasets demonstrated the efficiency and versatility of our system with an average of 98.74% accuracy and 98.18% f1-score."
610;"Delivering on sustainable development goals in wastewater reuse for agriculture: Initial prioritization of emerging pollutants in the Tula Valley, Mexico";"Andrea-Lorena Garduno-Jim ? ?enez a , Juan-Carlos Duran- ? Alvarez ? b , Catharine A. Ortori c , Salah Abdelrazig c , David A. Barrett c , Rachel L. Gomes a,";"Wastewater reuse for agricultural irrigation is a widespread beneficial practice, in line with the sustainable development goals. However, contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) present in wastewater, such as pharmaceuticals, pose an environmental risk. The Tula Valley in Mexico is one of the world?s largest agricultural areas reusing wastewater for agriculture. However, no untargeted CEC monitoring has been undertaken there, limiting the information available to prioritise local environmental risk assessment. Furthermore, CEC environmental presence in the Global South remains understudied, compared to the Global North. There is a risk that current research efforts focus on CECs predominantly found in the Global North, leading to strategies that may not be appropriate for the Global South where the pollution profile may be different. To address these knowledge gaps, a sampling campaign at five key sites in the Tula Valley was undertaken and samples analysed using multi-residue targeted and untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods. Using the targeted data, ten CECs were found to be of environmental risk for at least one sampling site: 4-tert-octylphenol, acetaminophen, bezafibrate, diclofenac, erythromycin, levonorgestrel, simvastatin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and tramadol as well as total estrogenicity (combination of three steroid hormones). Six of these have not been previously quantified in the Tula Valley. Over one hundred pollutants never previously measured in the area were identified through untargeted analysis supported by library spectrum match. Examples include diclofenac and carbamazepine metabolites and area-specific pollutants such as the herbicide fomesafen. This research contributes to characterising the presence of CECs in the Global South, as well as providing site-specific data for the Tula Valley."

They are an important factor contributing to the reduction in wheat yield and quality. The current weed control methods in wheat fields have relied primarily on chemical control. The inability to determine the precise location of weeds has led to excessive usage and low utilization rate of pesticides, causing severe pollution. As agronomic operations evolve towards Agriculture 4.0, weed control technology in wheat fields is progressively becoming more precise and intelligent. Weed detection technologies and methods in wheat fields may provide the groundwork for improving the accuracy and efficiency in weeding. This study begins with a review of common weed species and distribution pattern in wheat fields and provides an in-depth analysis of current technologies and developments for weed detection. We focused on the current states of research in spectroscopy, image, imaging spectroscopy, depth information, and multi-modal information fusion for weed detection in wheat fields. We also summarized the trend of weed detection algorithms from traditional machine learning to deep learning and proposed trends of future development in wheat field weed detection. Our study has contributed to the implementation of more automatic and precise weeds management."
612;Predictive analytics in Agriculture: Forecasting prices of Arecanuts in Kerala;"Kiran M. Sabu*a,b, T. K. Manoj Kumarb";"The fluctuations in prices of agricultural commodities have an adverse effect on the GDP of a country. The farmers are emotionally and financially affected as their years of hard work go in vain. Prediction of the prices may help the agriculture supply chain in making necessary decisions in minimizing and managing the risk of price fluctuations. As a result of the reduction in agricultural production due to unstable climatic conditions, global warming etc., predictive analytics is expected to solve the problems of the common man. Arecanut is an important crop cultivated in India, with Kerala being second in terms of production. In recent years farmers in Kerala are shifting from arecanut cultivation to other crops because of price fluctuations and climate change. In this work, the monthly prices of arecanut in Kerala are predicted using time-series and machine learning models. The models SARIMA, HoltWinter?s Seasonal method, and LSTM neural network were used, and their performance was evaluated based on the RMSE value on the arecanut dataset with prices from 2007 to 2017. LSTM neural network model was found to be the best model that fits the data"
613;Automated climate prediction using pelican optimization based hybrid deep belief network for Smart Agriculture;"A. Punitha a,* , V. Geetha b";"A significant part of the economies of several nations throughout the world, including India, where agriculture accounts for 16% of the total economy. Due to their dynamic and turbulent natures, climate prediction in this region is the most difficult because statistical methodologies can?t provide accurate predictions. Typically, weather forecasts were made using extraordinarily complex physics techniques that took into account various atmospheric conditions over a long time. These circumstances were usually unstable as a result of weather system disturbances, which led to the development of techniques for making unreliable predictions. In this study, an Automated Climate Prediction for Smart Agriculture is developed utilizing a Pelican Optimization-based Hybrid Deep Belief Network (ACP-POHDBN). The purpose of the ACP-POHDBN approach is to identify the appropriate meteorological conditions. The acp-POHDBN method uses the test data to calculate the appropriate weather conditions. Pre-processing, prediction, and hyperparameter tuning are the three key steps that make up the proposed ACP-POHDBN approach. The min-max normalization procedure is the primary procedure used by the ACP-POHDBN model to convert the meteorological data into a standard format. In addition to pre-processing data, the Deep Belief Network (DBN) model is used to forecast weather conditions. Finally, the DBN method?s hyperparameters (epoch, batch size, and learning rate) may be properly tuned using the POA-based hyperparameter tuning technique. The development of a Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA)-based hyperparameter optimizer for the process of predicting the climate demonstrates the originality of the study. The proposed algorithm over other recent approaches with maximum accuracy of 95.03%, sensitivity of 95.03%, specificity of 95.03%, and F-score of 95.03%."
614;Assessing the performance of satellite soil moisture on agricultural drought monitoring in the North China Plain;"Meng Cao a,b , Min Chen a,* , Ji Liu a , Yanli Liu b";"Satellite soil moisture (SM) has been increasingly available and the use of SM-based indices has a great potential for agricultural drought monitoring. This study evaluates the performance of two satellite SM products, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), on drought detection and assessment in the North China Plain (NCP) over the period of 2015?2018, with a comparison between two SMbased drought indices, Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) and Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI). Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Vegetation Drought Index (VDI) were adopted as the reference indices. Overall, SMAP outperformed SMOS in SM data validation as well as drought detection in the NCP region. A simple bias correction of the satellite SM data was able to improve their performance in characterizing agricultural drought via SM-based indices. Compared with SWDI, SMCI appeared to be the more appropriate index for drought monitoring, by showing a better agreement with both VCI and VDI in terms of drought characteristics (i.e. spatial distribution, drought category and frequency), though both SM-based indices overestimated drought severity to some extent. A simply SM-based drought indicator could be effective when satellite SM was applied for capturing agricultural drought, and a full consideration of longer term satellite data might be necessary."
615;Evaluation of the storage and evapotranspiration terms of the water budget for an agricultural watershed using local and remote-sensing measurements;"Lucas E.B. Hoeltgebaum a , Nelson Lu? Dias b,";"The understanding of the water budget components, especially evapotranspiration and the amount of water stored in the watershed, is key to water resources management and hydrological modeling in general. In this work, we present the analysis of 13 hydrological years? measurements of discharge, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture over two agricultural watersheds in Eastern Nebraska, United States. These data were used to investigate several facets of the hydrological water budget: water- and energybalance closures, water budget residues (here, the water budget residue is the remaining imbalance after all water budget terms have been considered see Eq. (13)), storage in the unsaturated and saturated soil layers, and the evapotranspiration derived from the water budget. Remote-sensing data were also used to assess the spatial variability of net radiation and soil moisture over the basins. Adjusting the eddycovariance measured evapotranspiration to close the energy budget agreed, in the long term, with the water budget evapotranspiration estimates. The evapotranspiration estimated with storage calculated with soil moisture measurements and recession analysis presented the best agreement with the (adjusted) measured evapotranspiration, but considering only either the vadose zone or the saturated zone for storage estimates still produced reasonable results. We found considerable variability in soil moisture over the basins in the final period of the growing season, coinciding with the time of the year when water budget residues were largest."

617;Environmental management on agricultural land: Cost benefit analysis of an integrated cropping system for provision of environmental public goods;"Michaela Roberts a,* , Cathy Hawes b , Mark Young b";"Agricultural land covers a significant portion of the earths land surface. Although the predominant function of agricultural land is food production, environmental public goods, such as biodiversity or soil maintenance, are also essential for long-term sustainability. In arable farms the type of cropping system used has a major impact on delivery of these environmental goods. Low input, integrated and regenerative cropping systems aim to improve environmental outcomes of arable farming, with the goal of reducing external inputs by supporting internal regulation of system processes. However, the production of environmental goods does not have an immediate market value to the farmer, and often comes at a cost, particularly in the early stages of transition to a more sustainable system. We estimate the on-farm costs and benefits of an integrated cropping system during the first six years of transition from intensive conventional management at the Centre for Sustainable Cropping in north east Scotland. Although integrated cropping had better environmental outcomes, all crops had higher financial margins in the conventional system compared to the integrated system, which suffered a loss of over ?500 per ha per year across the full rotation. This indicates that financial incentives are likely to be important to allow farmers to transition towards a more environmentally friendly cropping system."
618;"Does the substitution effect lead to feedback effect linkage between ethanol, crude oil, and soft agricultural commodities?";"Pawan Kumar a , Vipul Kumar Singh b , Sandeep Rao c";"Despite increased demand for cleaner fuel alternatives such as ethanol in recent decades, portfolio weight allocation has become challenging due to the complex interlinkage amongst crude, ethanol and soft agricultural commodities that form part of the value chain. As a result, portfolio returns face three trade-offs in terms of risk: dispersion across mean, risk arising due to market interconnectedness, and risk arising due to global shocks for assets sharing common macroeconomic fundamentals. This study proposes an optimal weight allocation portfolio strategy, encapsulating the three risk measures and returns, estimated using state-of-the-art multi-objective elitist Non-Dominated Sorting Algorithm II (NSGA-II). Our proposed strategy performs well for newly constituted objectives against the Markowitz Mean-Variance approach and Global Minimum Variance. A balanced diversification escapes the feedback spillover loop trap at the same time. Our results indicate that soybean oil, sugar, and rice offer a better reward to risk, aiding portfolio immunisation to extreme market movements. Furthermore, using GJR-GARCH volatility to capture the volatility asymmetry effect, the Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (GFEVD) shows the existence of a strong triplet pair Crude-Ethanol-Soybean as a breeding ground for the feedback effect to occur. Moreover, replacing crude weight with ethanol depicts a fall in spillover risk up to a threshold of 30% Ethanol weight, after which the feedback effect kicks in."

Ultrasonic waves were used to facilitate the formation of uniform Fe3O4-contained dry precursor gel before converting to the magnetic BEA zeolite composite for the first time. Magnetic RHAS-BEA was then characterized and compared with a non-magnetic sample (RHAS-BEA) using X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. In terms of adsorption, we found that paraquat had a high adsorption rate on the samples and conformed to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption behavior of paraquat on the synthesized RHAS-BEA and magnetic RHAS-BEA obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The synthesized adsorbents were reusable for at least four cycles, via thermal regeneration at 450 C. The inclusion of Fe3O4 particles in magnetic RHAS-BEA disrupted neither the crystallization of the BEA zeolite nor the adsorption of paraquat and enabled easy collection via an external magnet."
621;Co-hydrothermal carbonization of agricultural waste and sewage sludge for product quality improvement: Fuel properties of hydrochar and fertilizer quality of aqueous phase;"Guangchun Shan a,b , Weiguang Li b , Shanshan Bao c , Yangyang Li d , Wenbing Tan a,*";"Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a promising carbon-neutral technology for converting sewage sludge (SS) and agricultural waste into energy. However, HTC-generated aqueous phase (AP) impedes the development of the former. This study investigated the potential of SS with rice husk (RH) and wheat straw (WS) co-HTC to form hydrochar and AP as substitutes for fuel and chemical fertilizer, respectively. Compared with single SS hydrochar, the yield of co-HTC-based hydrochar and higher heating value significantly increased by 10.9%?21.6% and 4.2%?182.7%, reaching a maximum of 72.6% and 14.7 MJ/kg, respectively. Co-HTC improves the safe handling, storage and transportation, and combustion performance of hydrochar. The total nitrogen concentration in AP?SS was 2575 mg/L, accounting for 67.7% of that found in SS. Co-HTC decreased and increased the amine and phenolic components of AP, respectively. AP?SS?RH and AP?SS?WS significantly increased pakchoi dry weight by 45.5% and 49.4%, respectively, compared with AP?SS. The results of the hydroponic experiments with AP instead of chemical fertilizers revealed that AP?SS did not reduce pakchoi dry weight by replacing <20% chemical fertilizers. However, AP?SS?RH or AP?SS?WS replaced 60% chemical fertilizers. Therefore, the co-HTC of SS and agricultural waste increased the AP substitution of chemical fertilizer from 20% to 60%. These findings suggest that the co-HTC of agricultural waste with SS is a promising technology for converting SS into renewable resource products for fuels and N-rich liquid fertilizer while significantly improving fuel and fertilizer quality."

It is important to investigate the propagation among meteorological, agricultural and hydrological drought, as well as their major impacting factors, to improve understanding of the drought propagation relationship, monitor agricultural drought and reduce crop losses. This study presents the first exploration of the interplay between multiple droughts among different climate zones and seasons in China. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), standardized runoff index (SRI) and self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI) were used to represent meteorological, agricultural and hydrological drought, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the propagation relationships among different droughts and identify the most sensitive season for drought propagation. The Lindeman?Merenda?Gold (LMG) method was used to quantify the relative importance of PRE (precipitation), PET (potential evapotranspiration) and SM (soil moisture) to hydrological and agricultural drought. The propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought was prominent in different seasons at the annual scale over China. In general, the propagation relationship from agricultural to hydrological drought was weaker than that from meteorological to agricultural drought. In Northern China (arid and semi-arid areas), there was a stronger propagation relationship from agricultural to hydrological drought in summer and autumn than in spring. There was also stronger propagation from agricultural to hydrological drought in eastern China than in western China. Different climate regions had different major factors driving hydrological drought because of the different climate characteristics. However, SM was generally the most important driving factor for agricultural drought in all climate regions. Mulching plastic film might be an effective and feasible method to reduce PET from soil evaporation in subregions that apply high irrigation levels. These findings may also be applied to strengthen the study of artificial regulation of water resources, which could be an approach to reducing crop losses from drought."

Capparelli c , Damian ? J.G. Marino a,b";"Poultry litter (PL) is a majority waste of the intensive avian production, commonly used as an organic amendment in agricultural soils. We studied the input of pollutants from the PL, as inorganic P and ionophore antibiotics (IPA), and the influence on soil pollutants (GLP and AMPA) in real systems, after a rainfall simulation on an agronomic amended soil with PL at two residence times. Physicochemical parameters were altered in the runoff after the amendment. PL from commercial farms present a preliminary load of monensin and salinomycin. The mobility of IPA by surface runoff (0.8?31%) and leaching (0.4?38%) was determined, with monensin showing the maximum losses in both processes at both residence times. PL amendments act as a pollution diffuse source of IPA. Moreover, the amendment enhanced the mobility of GLP and AMPA in soils. Maximum losses of GLP in runoff increased from 0.56% to 9.84% in soil with PL treatment. The results were related to the amounts of P released in the surface runoff. Strategies for reducing the animal wastes and their antibiotic content must be investigated regarding the productive practice involving these residues, as water and soil conservation are proven to be a key asset in the sustainability and success of circular economy processes. This is the first study to demonstrate the combined release of pollutants from multiple origins, after the amendment with poultry litter on real agricultural soils."
628;JumpStart of soil organic matter with highly stabilized organic amendment: Implication for climate-smart agriculture;"Guanglong Tiana,* , Chih-Yu Chiub , Olawale Oladeji a , Theresa Johnstona , Benjamin Morgana , Albert Coxa , Thomas Granatoa,1 , Heng Zhanga , Edward Podczerwinski a";"Rebuilding soil organic matter (SOM) to regionally specific targets for high quality soil that are likely maintained in the long term, here defined as ?SOM JumpStart?, can unlock soil?s potential for increased productivity, enhanced resilience and reduced emission as the main components for climate-smart agriculture (CSA). A field experiment was established in 2013 at Fulton County, western Illinois to use highly stabilized organic amendment (HSOA) at a rate, potentially raising surface SOM of cultivated Alfisol (low quality soil) to the level of cultivated Mollisol (high quality soil for US Midwest). Treatments included one-time application of lagoon-aged air-dried biosolids at 165 Mg ha-1, one-time application of vegetative compost at 165 Mg ha-1, chemical fertilizer at 225?50?85 kg ha-1 yr-1 (N-P-K) as control, and grass fallow as reference. In every year following the HSOA application, fertilizer (N and K) rate was reduced by 25%, and no P was applied for most years. Corn was planted annually. The HSOA JumpStart application dramatically increased SOM, leading to soil organic carbon (SOC) at 2?2.5% after biosolids and about 3% after compost for 2013?2019, as that of Mollisol, while that in chemical fertilizer control remained unchanged at 1?1.2%. For the first seven years, HSOA JumpStart increased corn grain yield by a mean of 19.8% (biosolids) and 7.1% (compost) above the control, with greater increase at precipitations-abnormal (low/high) years. The SOM JumpStart caused the shift of soil microbial physiology to high C utilization efficiency, as evident by reduced microbial metabolic quotient for CO2, leading to the decrease in CO2 emission from agricultural crop residues by 19.6% (biosolids) and 20.0% (compost). Our modeling revealed the promising soil C sequestration (excluding residual C from HSOA) over next 50 years at 10.6 Mg C ha-1 by biosolids application and 13.9 Mg C ha-1 by compost application, higher than 6.8 Mg C ha-1 anticipated by ?4 per 1000 international initiative. A simple but straightforward model suggests JumpStarted soil still contain 50% higher SOC stocks as compared to control after 50 years. Our results suggest the SOM JumpStart by HSOA such as biosolids and compost can transform conventional corn production to CSA."
629;New method for diagnosing resilience of agricultural soil-water resource composite system: Projection pursuit model modified by sparrow search algorithm;"Dan Xu a,1 , Deping Liu a,1 , Dong Liu a,b,c,d,* , Qiang Fu a,* , Yan Huang e , Mo Li a , Tianxiao Li a";"Considering the driving mechanism of agricultural soil?water resource composite system (ASWRS) resilience, the Jiansanjiang Branch of China Beidahuang Agricultural Reclamation Group Co., Ltd., is selected as the research object. A projection pursuit (PP) model improved by the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) was proposed to measure the key drivers of resilience, and the driving mechanism of resilience was analysed in combination with the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI). The performance of the built model and the rationality of the results were verified, thus providing a new horizon for the healthy and sustainable development of agricultural water and soil resources and the environment. The results indicated that the SSA-PP model constructed in this paper was superior to PP models based on genetic algorithm (GA) optimization (GA-PP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO-PP) in regard to the solution speed and optimization ability, and these three models yielded similar conclusions. Compared with those of the entropy weight (EW) method, the driving results of the SSA-PP model are more significant, and the screened key driving factors are more reasonable. It was finally determined that the impact on the resilience of the ASWRS was the result of the joint action of economic and agricultural systems. The key driving factors included the per capita gross domestic product (GDP), paddy field proportion, per capita net income and grain output per unit area. According to the LMDI results, the economic level, grain output and paddy field proportion increased, which played a positive role in driving resilience. With the use of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to simulate the future evolution of the key driving factors, it was predicted that the resilience level will increase year by year in the future. It was found that accelerating the economic development process, increasing the grain output, implementing rational planning and adjusting the agricultural planting structure are effective ways to enhance resilience."

Bharath a , Muhamad Fazly Abdul Patah b , Wan Mohd Ashri Wan Daud b , Rambabu K. a , PauLoke Show c , Fawzi Banat a,";"Organic biomass pyrolysis to produce biochar is a viable approach to sustainably convert agricultural residues. The yield and SSA of biochar are contingent upon the biomass type and pyrolysis conditions, and their quantification necessitates the investment of time, energy, and resources. Therefore, in this study, data from 46 different types of biomass were extracted from the published literature and modeled based on a supervised machine learning approach with five different regression algorithms to predict the total yield and SSA of biochar. In general, the collected data were processed using a data exploration technique to remove outliers. The correlation between input variables was examined using the Pearson correlation coefficient method to eliminate highly correlated input variables, and the assorted data was further imputed for developing predictive models. The yield and SSA of biochar were predicted by feature importance analysis to reduce the computational complexity and latency of the model. Out of the 14 input variables, 9 were selected based on feature importance and redundancy, wherein pyrolysis temperature demonstrated the greatest relative importance of 33.6% in predicting targets. Compared to other models developed to predict total biochar yield and SSA, Random Forests performs better, having a maximum R2 value of 85% and a minimum absolute root mean squared error (RMSE) for both biochar yield and SSA. Therefore, the developed models could help predict total biochar yield and SSA for a variety of agricultural biomasses without the need for complex and energy-intensive pyrolysis experiments"

CT (conventional tillage) in maize-CT in wheat, CT-ZT (ZT, zero tillage), ZT-ZT, ZT-ZTR (ZTR, zero tillage in amalgamation with remainder integration) & ZTR-ZTR and three weed management practices viz. H (suggested herbicide in maize)-H (suggested herbicide in wheat), IWM-IWM (IWM, integrated weed supervision) & HW-HW (HW, hand weeding) were calculated in strip plot design. Significant differences (p = 0.05) of weed density and total weed count were recorded during summer (maize) and winter (wheat) seasons. Among tillage treatments, lowest weed population and total weed population were recorded in conservation tillage (ZTR-ZTR) in summer and conservative tillage followed by zero tillage in winter season (CT-ZT), respectively. IWM-IWM and H-H had a least weed population and total weed population in summer and winter seasons, respectively. Highest important value index during summer and winter seasons was recorded in Echinochloa colona (55.90%) and Avena ludoviciana (76.99%), respectively. Higher Shannon Wiener index and Evenness were recorded for CT+HW-CT+HW (1.83, 0.91) and ZT +IWM-ZTR+IWM (1.73, 0.86) which indicate higher weed species diversity during summer and winter seasons, respectively. ZTR-ZTR led to less diverse weed diversity compared to intensive conventional tillage (CT-CT) practices. However, higher Simpson?s diversity was recorded for CT+HW-CT+HW, i.e. 0.83 and 0.82 for maize and wheat, respectively, compared to the other conventional tillage treatments. This study helps in understanding the crop-weed relation such that the implementation of sound and economic weeds management strategies. Further, long-term experiments are required in order to interpret the complicated relationships of diverse weed species under different tillage and weed management strategies for sustainable and adoptive conservation agriculture production system for North Western Himalayas"
632;Landscape drivers of mammal habitat use and richness in a protected area and its surrounding agricultural lands;"Beatriz Bellon? a,b,* , Dominic A.W. Henry d,e , Pierre-Cyril Renaud b,c , Fabio de O. Roque f , Cyntia Cavalcante Santosf , Isabel Melo f , Damien Arvor g , Alta de Vos a";"Protected areas (PAs) are key to conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services globally, but their effectiveness increasingly depends on the ability of the surrounding agricultural areas to support biodiversity and secure connectivity at the landscape level. This requires monitoring the broader multi-use landscapes in which PAs exist and identifying the landscape characteristics that support rich, functional wildlife communities. Here, we investigated the species richness and habitat use patterns of a mammal community in relation to different landscape variables and land use and land cover (LULC) types in a PA and its surrounding agricultural lands in the Cerrado. We first used a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model with input camera trap data and eight landscape variables (vegetation productivity, phenology, and heterogeneity, distance to water, roads and settlements, and the PA, slope, and elevation) to estimate the species richness and habitat use of 29 mammal species across the landscape. We then analyzed the relationships between the species richness and habitat use and the landscape variables at the site level, as well as the distribution of species at the landscape level in relation to the different natural and agricultural LULC types. We found that most species are present in the native forest areas across the landscape and that many species are also present in the croplands surrounding the PA. The results also showed that species? habitat use was especially determined by the productivity and heterogeneity of the vegetation cover, with a particularly strong positive relation in grasslands and pastures. These results suggest that the private properties surrounding the PA might be playing an essential role in supporting biodiversity in this region and provide insights on management practices that could largely contribute to maintaining or promoting a multifunctional landscape, such as maintaining the remaining forests or increasing the productivity and the heterogeneity (e.g., by increasing tree cover) in pastures."
633;Real-time 3D unstructured environment reconstruction utilizing VR and Kinect-based immersive teleoperation for agricultural field robots;"Yi Chen, Baohua Zhang? , Jun Zhou? , Kai Wang";"Moving and operating autonomously in a field or orchard environment is challenging for agricultural robots due to the complex task requirements and highly unstructured conditions. The human?computer interaction-based remote control can provide the robots with an alternative solution to assist decision making and motion planning. In this study, a virtual reality (VR) and Kinect-based immersive teleoperation system were proposed to connect the physical and virtual world by utilizing real-time large-scale unstructured agricultural environment reconstruction and simultaneous virtual environment creation. The proposed system, with a relatively large server, can convert the scene into a realistic model by combing the depth and color image streams received from Kinect, and project them back into 3D (three dimensions) space in such a manner that the real 3D scene inside the camera?s field of view is recreated virtually. To create a VR environment for a VR headset, an optimized Bundlefusion-based algorithm was developed for real-time 3D reconstruction of the unstructured agricultural scene in the natural environment. Additionally, the performance of the proposed real-time 3D reconstruction algorithm was evaluated and compared with Bundlefusion and voxel hashing algorithms in different large-scale unstructured agricultural environments. Performing optimizing pose on our optimized algorithm leverages a large number of processing cores available to minimize the delay between data capture and rendering, and it reduces the average acquired time to process each frame no more than 0.9 ms. The experimental results including, less computer storage occupied, fast frame processing time, and high-quality 3D realistic model indicate that our proposed system and algorithm have the potential applicability of immersive teleoperation in an unstructured agricultural environment."
634;Efficient treatment of bio-contaminated wastewater using plasma technology for its reuse in sustainable agriculture;"Saeed Kooshki * , Pankaj Pareek, Robin Mentheour, M?io Janda, Zdenko Machala";"Water-related crisis represents one of the significant challenges of the rapidly growing world population. This study demonstrates an example of the novel technology of NonThermal Plasma (NTP) wastewater treatment for its sustainable recovery and reuse in agriculture. NTP treatment of wastewater not only causes microbial decontamination but produces Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species (RONS), which can consequently improve seed germination and plant growth. We investigated the effects of the new Fountain Dielectric Barrier Discharge air plasma reactor for the treatment of bulk quantity water contaminated by Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli bacteria. Then, employing the treated water for barley seed germination showed >20% enhancement compared to using tap water. The inactivation of bacteria in water was determined in dependence on pH, Oxidation-Reduction Potential, and correlated with chemical RONS produced in the water (hydrogen peroxide, nitrites, and especially nitrates). By utilizing the Responses Surface Methodology, we identified the optimal plasma treatment time per litre required for efficient RONS production and bactericidal effect in the wastewater treatment, which was linearly scalable with water volume. After the optimum plasma treatment time, a sharp drop in pH, and the concentrations of nitrites and hydrogen peroxide were observed, which is related to the peroxynitrite formation leading to the significant bacterial reduction up to 7-log"

Novel sensors add value in soil-less farming through automation and IoT (Internet of Things) based operation management digital tools. Data-driven technologies by using smart sensors can find a solution to many glitches in agriculture practices and it could improve new efficiencies. The principles of smart sensors as well as the most viable sensors that are used for monitoring soil and plant physicochemical parameters in field cultivation processes, greenhouse and indoor hydroponics are being discussed. Digital technologies in precision farming, automation in agro machinery, Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), TV White Spaces (TVWS) remote connectivity, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based imagery, application of IoTs can help farming communities to use resources accurately based on real-time farm data acquired and improve crop yield without any wastage. Smart sensors helps the entire food value chain, the precision to productivity quest of growers and could enable new business models. This article provides a wide understanding of novel smart sensors, wireless sensor network architectures, and applications of these sensors to inculcate sustainable farming practices, value chain traceability and create secured income."
636;COVID-19 induced lockdown effects on agricultural commodity prices and consumer behaviour in India ? Implications for food loss and waste management;"AG Adeeth Cariappa a , Kamlesh Kumar Acharya a , Chaitanya Ashok Adhav a , R. Sendhil b,* , P. Ramasundaram c";"Distortion in distribution and consumption of agricultural commodities is a result of disruptive shocks in prices and food value chains leading to a significant food loss as well as waste. We investigated the COVID-19 induced lockdown effects in India through an interrupted time series analysis coupled with a survey result of 729 consumers, 225 farmers and synthesis of the literature evidence on food loss as well as food waste. Our article complements the literature inventory on COVID-19 by estimating and tracking the effects on prices and consumer behaviour apart from discussing the implications for food loss and waste. Prices post-lockdown shot up immediately and significantly for chickpea (4.8%), mung bean (5.2%), and tomato (78.2%) corroborating the loss in highly perishable product ? tomato ? owing to its spiked price. We find no structural break in prices due to lockdown implying that lockdown-induced price change was not sufficient to alter the long-run price movement, and the prices of the major commodities reverted to the pre-lockdown levels. The pandemic induced lockdown did restrict the access to food markets and a majority of consumers (75.31%) experienced a price increase across COVID zones of different intensity of incidence leading to food loss along supply chain and wastage at consumers end. Consumers? livelihood affected from moderate (59.53%) to severe (3.3%) with 92 per cent reporting a change in shopping behavior. The Kruskal-Wallis test on consumption behavior change indicated a significant shift among the consumers reporting altered income, mostly in the downside, post-lockdown. Despite the relaxation for agricultural related activities during the lockdown, farmers reported disruption in disposing their winter produce barring wheat, bolstered by a record state procurement in 2020. The paper affirms that the pandemic has caused a significant price change and unprecedented panic purchase that led to the food wastage but subsided soon exhibiting the resilience in Indian agriculture. We strongly recommend for promoting the capacity and collective resilience of small-scale production systems through institutions, policies and reforms. Contract farming, farmer producer organizations, creation and functioning of social safety nets to overcome income, production and price shocks, access to digital national markets and capacity building on food waste management practices will insulate vulnerable section as well as reduce the loss of food across supply chain."
637;"How wide, how much? A framework for quantifying the economic and ecological outcomes of altering riparian width on agricultural land";"James Malcher ? , Kay Critchell, Ty G. Matthews, Rebecca E. Lester";"Creating and managing riparian buffer zones (RBZs) is regarded as a global best-practice management strategy for maintaining and improving waterway health. Agricultural land often utilises RBZs as highly productive pasture, exposing waterways to increased inputs of nutrients, pollutants, and sediment, in addition to reducing carbon sequestration and habitat for native flora and fauna. This project developed a novel approach to the application of multisystem ecological and economic quantification models to the property-scale, at low cost and high speed. We developed a state-of-the-art dynamic geospatial interface to communicate these outputs when switching from pasture to revegetated riparian zone via planned restoration efforts. The tool was developed using the regional conditions of a south-east Australian catchment as a case study but is designed to be adaptable around globally using equivalent model inputs. Ecological and economic outcomes were determined using existing methods, including an agricultural land suitability analysis to quantify primary production, an estimation of carbon sequestration using historic vegetation datasets and GIS software analysis to determine spatial costings of revegetation and fencing. Economic outcomes are presented in raw values of pasture produced and carbon sequestered, and fencing and revegetation costs can be easily altered for enhanced usability and interoperability. This tool can provide property-specific data for almost 16,000 properties in a catchment area of over 130,000 km2 and 19,600 km of river length. Our results indicated that current financial incentives for revegetation rarely cover the cost of giving up pasture, but these costs may be compensated by social and ecological outcomes achieved over time. This method provides a novel way of informing alternative management approaches, such as incremental revegetation plans and the selective harvesting of timber from RBZ. The model provides an innovative framework for improved RBZ management and can be used to inform property-specific responses and guide discussion among stakeholders."
638;The role of crop classification in detecting wheat yield variation for index-based agricultural insurance in arid and semiarid environments;"Sarvarbek Eltazarov * , Ihtiyor Bobojonov, Lena Kuhn, Thomas Glauben";"The increasing availability of open-source and high-quality satellite data has facilitated market developments in the index insurance sector. So far, research and industry spheres have used administrative boundaries of units to estimate regional index values for insurance design. In areas with heterogeneous land use or land cover, however, these indices do not provide sufficient accuracy. This study analyzes potential accuracy gains from land-use classification that allow to design indices specifically for croplands and wheatlands. The validity of this approach is tested along conventional satellite-based products, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST), as well as indices that are not yet widely used in crop insurance industry, like the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI). The study covers 2060 yield observations from 152 districts across Central Asia and Mongolia with irrigated, mixed and rainfed wheat farming systems. The results show that the majority of these indices are suitable for detecting wheat yield variations in rainfed and mixed agricultural lands, although they remain ambiguous in irrigated lands. Land-use classification and designing indices based on croplands and wheatlands noticeably increases the relationship between indices and wheat yields in rainfed and mixed lands. Notably, the LAI and GCI out-perform other well-known indices. Overall, freely available satellite data could serve as a good source for establishing index insurance products in Central Asia and Mongolia. Nevertheless, a careful assessment and selection of index and land use classification remains essential."
639;Impact of environmental regulation perception on farmers? agricultural green production technology adoption: A new perspective of social capital;"Zhangdong Guo a , Xiaoqi Chen b , Yongwang Zhang a";"At present, how to promote agricultural green production technology (AGPT) to achieve agricultural green production is one of the hot issues discussed by various countries and academia. From the perspective of farmers? environmental regulation perception and social capital, there is still a lack of research on the farmers? AGPT adoption behavior. Therefore, based on the survey data of kiwifruit growers in Mei and Zhouzhi counties of Shaanxi Province, China, this study applies Poisson model to empirically analyze the impact of farmers? environmental regulation perception and social capital and interaction on their AGPT adoption behavior and further reveals the intergenerational differences in AGPT adoption behavior between the new and old generation farmers. After dealing with endogenous problems, the conclusion is still robust. The study found that farmers? AGPT adoption rate was 71.7%, but the degree of AGPT adoption was only 1.46, and most of AGPT had not been popularized. Secondly, farmers? environmental regulation perception and social capital can significantly promote their AGPT adoption, and the promotion of incentive environmental regulation perception and disembedded social capital is more obvious. Thirdly, environmental regulation perception and social capital have interactive effect on farmers? AGPT adoption. At the same time, social capital can strengthen environmental regulation perception on farmers? AGPT adoption. Finally, the intergenerational difference analysis shows that old generation of farmers? AGPT adoption is generally affected by environmental perception regulation and social capital, while new generation of farmers is mainly affected by guiding environmental regulation perception. Based on the above conclusions, we provide policy suggestions for promoting farmers to adopt AGPT."
640;Agricultural commercialization and nutrition evidence from smallholder coffee farmers;"Joanna van Asselt a,? , Pilar Useche b";"Agricultural commercialization, or the transition from growing crops for home consumption to growing some or all crops for sale, enables farmers to earn cash income that they can use to buy food in markets. This additional income may enable smallholders to purchase more healthy and/or unhealthy calories in the market, impacting their nutrition. While previous studies have examined the impact of commercialization on undernutrition, this study analyzes the impact of commercialization on overweight and obesity. Survey data from smallholder coffee farmers in rural Guatemala is used to estimate the impact of commercialization on body mass index for male and female household heads. Additionally, we explore the different pathways through which commercialization can impact nutrition, including household calorie availability, crop production, income, and gender. The empirical analysis employs an instrumental variable approach to control for endogeneity issues. Our estimation results suggest that commercialization, both in general and through dependence on coffee, leads to overweight and obesity in more commercialized households. Further, our analysis shows that while there is no relationship between commercialization of crops in general and household calorie availability, coffee dependence lowers household calorie availability. We also find that coffee dependent households decrease their production diversity and do not earn more agricultural income, both of which may negatively contribute to their nutrition. As rural areas become increasingly integrated with markets, understanding the transmission channels between agricultural commercialization and nutrition is critical."
641;Daily dynamic thresholds of different agricultural drought grades for summer maize based on the Vegetation Water Index;"Yuanda Zhang a,b , Peijuan Wang b,* , Yuye Chen b , Jianying Yang b , Dingrong Wu b , Yuping Ma b , Zhiguo Huo a,b , Shuxian Liu c";"Effective daily drought monitoring for summer maize (Zea mays L.) is critical to prevent crop yield reduction. Most of the vegetation indicators used for drought identification have been based on changes in canopy greenness that may not change immediately under drought stress, and have relatively long-time intervals (e.g., eight or 16 days) that are limited by available remote sensing products. Moreover, drought thresholds, may be potentially different during different crop growth stages, rather than constant during the entire growing season, as has been widely used in most existing drought indicators. We used the orthorectified reflectance in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band, extracted from MODIS MCD43A4 because of its high sensitivity to variations in vegetation water content due to this waveband?s liquid water absorption characteristics. The Vegetation Water Index (VWI), calculated with the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), was proposed for daily drought monitoring of summer maize in order to minimize the effects of geographical location, soil conditions, and ecological systems in different areas. Additionally, daily dynamic thresholds for drought-free, mild drought, moderate drought, and severe drought were determined with double logistic fitting functions having the highest R2 (0.79), based on the observed drought disaster and phenophase records of summer maize in the Huang-HuaiHai region (HHH). Drought samples constructed from regional drought records and the Yearbook of Meteorological Disasters in China were used for drought validations. The results exhibited high accuracy (78.04% of total drought samples correctly showing complete correspondence with historical records regarding drought grades, and 96.90% of drought samples being within one drought grade level). Additionally, compared with the Crop Water Deficit Index (CWDI), the temporal and spatial evolution of typical drought processes were more accurately characterized by VWI. The results of this study provide a scientific basis and achieve quantitative monitoring for daily drought assessment of summer maize in HHH, and also provide a new perspective in dynamic and quantitative monitoring of agricultural disasters over large regions based on actual disaster records and remotely sensed images."
642;Using long time series of agricultural-derived nitrates for estimating catchment transit times;"O. Fovet a,b,? , L. Ruiz a,b , M. Faucheux a,b , J. Mol?at c , M. Sekhar d , F. Vert? a,b , L. Aquilina e,f , C. Gascuel-Odoux a,b , P. Durand a,b";"The estimation of water and solute transit times in catchments is crucial for predicting the response of hydrosystems to external forcings (climatic or anthropogenic). The hydrogeochemical signatures of tracers (either natural or anthropogenic) in streams have been widely used to estimate transit times in catchments as they integrate the various processes at stake. However, most of these tracers are well suited for catchments with mean transit times lower than about 4?5 years. Since the second half of the 20th century, the intensification of agriculture led to a general increase of the nitrogen load in rivers. As nitrate is mainly transported by groundwater in agricultural catchments, this signal can be used to estimate transit times greater than several years, even if nitrate is not a conservative tracer. Conceptual hydrological models can be used to estimate catchment transit times provided their consistency is demonstrated, based on their ability to simulate the stream chemical signatures at various time scales and catchment internal processes such as N storage in groundwater. The objective of this study was to assess if a conceptual lumped model was able to simulate the observed patterns of nitrogen concentration, at various time scales, from seasonal to pluriannual and thus if it was relevant to estimate the nitrogen transit times in headwater catchments. A conceptual lumped model, representing shallow groundwater flow as two parallel linear stores with double porosity, and riparian processes by a constant nitrogen removal function, was applied on two paired agricultural catchments which belong to the Research Observatory ORE AgrHys. The Global Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) approach was used to estimate parameter values and uncertainties. The model performance was assessed on (i) its ability to simulate the contrasted patterns of stream flow and stream nitrate concentrations at seasonal and inter-annual time scales, (ii) its ability to simulate the patterns observed in groundwater at the same temporal scales, and (iii) the consistency of long-term simulations using the calibrated model and the general pattern of the nitrate concentration increase in the region since the beginning of the intensification of agriculture in the 1960s. The simulated nitrate transit times were found more sensitive to climate variability than to parameter uncertainty, and average values were found to be consistent with results from others studies in the same region involving modeling and groundwater dating. This study shows that a simple model can be used to simulate the main dynamics of nitrogen in an intensively polluted catchment and then be used to estimate the transit times of these pollutants in the system which is crucial to guide mitigation plans design and assessment"
643;Efficiency of technologies to live with drought in agricultural development in Brazil?s semi-arid regions;"Thiago Abrantes Silva * , J?essica Ferreira , Maria L?ia Calijuri , Vitor Juste dos Santos, Sabrina do Carmo Alves, Jackeline de Siqueira Castro";"Vulnerability to water stress brings challenges to water resources management in arid and semi-arid regions and it is an obstacle to socioeconomic development. In this sense, some technologies are used to overcome this bottleneck. The present study sought to investigate the insertion of cisterns and public irrigation schemes in seven sub-basins in Brazil?s semi-arid regions, to verify their effects on family farming agricultural development and their suitability according to water availability trend. These technologies were spatialized and agricultural production trend lines, between 1995 and 2017, were generated in order to indicate these technologies efficiency. Finally, the precipitation, surface and subsurface runoff trend was evaluated for all sub-basins. Trend analysis in agricultural production showed that a large part of the municipalities had a decrease in agricultural production and municipalities that had a larger number of cisterns did not achieve good agricultural development, while agricultural irrigation systems brought better results. Regarding physical-natural conditions, subsurface runoff has decreased and an increase in surface runoff was identified, which can be collected through the installation of new cisterns. However, for this purpose, future investigations are important to identify the factors that are affecting cisterns performance."
644;"Spatial modeling of soil loss as a response to land use-land cover change in Didessa sub-basin, the agricultural watershed of Ethiopia";"Kelil Usman a , Kiros Tsegay Deribew b,* , Girma Alemu c , Samuel Hailu d";"Soil erosion is a vector of disturbances to agricultural productivity and economic development in the western highlands of Ethiopia. Yet, tough vegetation cover loss swapped to other land uses could have amplified the soil loss rate at which land cover change preceded, but little is known about their effects on soil loss in the Limu-Seqa watershed. This study was designed to evaluate the historical trends of the effects of land use-land cover change on soil erosion dynamics as a threshold for potential monitoring of soil loss. Satellite image data of 1987, 2002, 2021, and DEM-20 m resolution were used. The RUSLE model was applied with primary parameters to generate soil loss. Findings show that average annual soil loss increased from 4.5 in 1987 to 13.5 t ha- 1 yr- 1 in 2002 and surpassed to 45.35 t ha- 1 yr- 1 in 2021 as a result of LULC changes, particularly the transition of forest and overgrazed land to cropland (43.83%) and dense-forest to poor-open-up forest (6.92%) between 1987 and 2021. Soil loss during the recent study period was substantially affected by a substantial LULC change, from forest to cropland. The severe and very severe erosion risk categories jointly cover more than half of the entire catchment, which contributes to two-thirds of the total mean annual soil loss in the watershed, which is found to be over and above soil loss tolerance (SLT) in Ethiopia and tropical regions. Therefore, given the robust economic and political status of priority conservation measures, red hues areas are significant."

This study took 15 farms in the Jiansanjiang Administration of Heilongjiang Province in China as the research object and constructed a resilience evaluation indicator system containing 31 indicators for the regional agricultural soil-water resource composite system (ASWRS). The combined weight (BFCM-CRITIC) and entropy weight (EW) combined with the variable fuzzy assessment (VFA) model and the improved technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) model were used to calculate the resilience exponent and to analyse the characteristics of space-time variation. The stability and reliability of the two models under different weights were verified by the Spearman correlation coefficient and discrimination theory to determine the optimal resilience exponent diagnosis method. The results show that according to the BFCM-CRITIC-VFA model, the levels of resilience were the highest at the Nongjiang, Hongwei and Erdaohe farms, and the resilience levels were strong and scattered. The resilience of the Jiansanjiang Administration has been increasing over time, and the spatial distribution has generally decreased from north to south and from the Heilong River and Wusuli River basins inland. A comparison of the reliability and stability of the two models for different weights indicates that the VFA model optimized based on combined weights was superior to the other methods in terms of stability and reliability, which verifies that the BFCMCRITIC-VFA model is the most suitable for measuring the resilience exponent."
646;Not all crops are equal: the impacts of agricultural investment on job creation by crop type and investor type;"Habiba Mohammed Yimam a,* , Logan Cochrane b,c,d , Melisew Dejene Lemma e";"Significant agricultural investment has taken place across Africa over the most recent two decades. An expanding set of literature analyzes these investments, often using case study and comparative approaches. While this is important, not all agricultural investments are equal, yet they are often described as being such. Few studies utilize large data sets to conduct quantitative, comparative research. This paper examines investments in Ethiopia, using quantitative data of 102 investments that took place in one region between 1998 and 2018. Using this unique dataset, we conduct a comparative assessment of investments, analyzing traits such as crop choice, job creation, job type, implementation status, and investor type (Ethiopian, foreign, diaspora). We find that Ethiopian investors are granted larger average leases of land, though are fewer in number in comparison to foreign and diaspora investors. The same category of investors (Ethiopians) have higher implementation status but have created the least per hectare permanent and seasonal jobs. The regression analysis, however, shows that there is no statistically significant difference among the three types of investors in terms of per hectare job creation. From the investment types, horticulture/flowers created the most employment per hectare, followed by vegetables and fruits production. This evidence contests common narratives about agricultural investment and provides a basis for decision makers to better enable positive outcomes, such as greater job creation."
647;Intersectoral systemic risk spillovers between energy and agriculture under the financial and COVID-19 crises;"Bo Zhu a,* , Renda Lin a , Yuanyue Deng a , Pingshe Chen a , Julien Chevallier b,c";"Considering the severity and frequency of industry-specific shocks, this paper examines how sector-induced contagion effects caused by significant crises (e.g., the global financial crisis and COVID-19) propagate between energy and agricultural sectors worldwide. Relevant literature fails to concern the influence of these crosssectoral transmission mechanisms on the energy-agriculture nexus and its relevance. By modifying the copulaextreme value theory-marginal expected shortfall (Copula-EVT-MES) method and using daily commodity returns from 2005M3?2020M5, our study captures significant intersectoral systemic risk spillovers, with asymmetrical and persistent patterns in energy-agricultural pairs. Furthermore, the bioethanol production (physical channel) and the financialization of commodities (financial channel) mainly relate to the shock spillovers. Compared to the financial crisis, the systemic risk spillovers in the COVID-19 crisis rely more on the physical channel, which emphasizes the importance of bioenergy-related shocks. The macro-conditions and supplydemand shocks are also important determinants for such spillovers during the ongoing crisis."
648;Identity theory in agriculture: Understanding how social-ecological shifts affect livestock ranchers and farmers in northeastern Colorado;"Jasmine E. Bruno a,* , Mar? E. Fernandez-Gim ? ?enez a , Meena M. Balgopal b";"This study examines how experiences and social interactions help form the occupational identities of livestock operators in northeastern (NE) Colorado. We also explore how their agricultural identities, especially related to gender roles, have shifted in the context of social and ecological change. Little research examines identities in the context of rapidly changing North American rangeland systems. To address this gap, we used identity theory to deductively analyze 32 interview transcripts with livestock keepers to examine their occupational identities and how shifting gender roles affect these identities. We first describe the context of social-ecological change in NE Colorado. We next illustrate participants? self-concepts, outlining their multiple identities (e.g., rancher and farmer), identity standards (i.e., how a rancher ?ought? to be), and identity symbols (i.e., elements with implied shared meaning). We found that, while history often presents the identities of farmers and ranchers as distinct and conflicting, participants described their roles as becoming increasingly plural (including dual farmer-rancher roles). Participants emphasized the significance of land, livestock, and way of life (i.e., culture) to their agricultural identities. While most participants discussed the increasing acceptance of women in agriculture, we also found that women have not always received public acknowledgment of their roles as farmers or ranchers. As livestock keepers are restructuring their identities in response to social and ecological change, we see opportunities to support the increased inclusion of diverse identities in agriculture. This more nuanced understanding of agricultural identities and their relationship to behavior can support researchers and practitioners in developing strategies that meet rangeland stakeholders? shifting needs. This study contributes to and offers new research directions for rural studies and the study of decision-making in agriculture."
649;"Optimal GIS interpolation techniques and multivariate statistical approach to study the soil-trace metal(loid)s distribution patterns in the agricultural surface soil of Matehuala, Mexico";"Arnab Sahaa , Bhaskar Sen Guptaa,* , Sandhya Patidar a , Nadia Mart?ez-Villegas b";"Soils in the past mining areas are susceptible to trace metal(loid)s deposition and pose a health risk to humans. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the distribution patterns and contamination characteristics of trace metal(loid)s in the agricultural surface soils of past mining regions. The contaminated site is near an abandoned mining area, which is surrounded by land used for maize cultivation. The multivariate statistical approach and GIS interpolation techniques are often used in spatial distribution mapping to predict metal(loid)s concentrations for arsenic (As) and other trace metals (i.e., Al, Fe, Mn, and Sr) in areas that have not been sampled. The mean relative error (MRE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values were used to evaluate and correlate the efficiency of deterministic interpolation (Inverse Distance Weighting- IDW, Local Polynomial- LP, and Radial Basis Functions- RBF) as well as geostatistical interpolation methods (Ordinary Kriging- OK and Empirical Bayesian Kriging- EBK). The results revealed that all interpolation techniques predicted the mean concentration of trace metal(loid)s in soil with moderate accuracy. It was found that agricultural soils contained arsenic enrichment (up to 185 mg/kg), up to five times the background concentrations (35 mg/kg), and 8.5 times the Mexican guidelines (22 mg/kg). The statistical analysis with the cross-validation method revealed that IDW and LP consistently provided the most accurate predictions of trace metal(loid)s concentrations while OK, EBK, and RBF techniques are less accurate. Overall, these GIS interpolation techniques help in the prediction of trace metal(loid)s concentrations at unexplored sites and establish the requirement for the amelioration of agricultural surface soil."
650;Spatio-temporal variability of porewater phosphorus concentrations in streambed sediments of an agricultural stream;"Meghan A. Vissers a , James W. Roy a,b , Adam G. Yates c , Kyle Robinson a , Sabina Rakhimbekova a , Clare E. Robinson a,*";"Streambed sediment and groundwater represent important stores of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in freshwater catchments yet their contributions to watershed SRP loads remain unclear. This study evaluates the spatio-temporal variability and geochemical and hydrologic controls on porewater SRP in the streambed along an agricultural reach, including the influence of groundwater-surface water interactions. High porewater SRP (>1000 ?g/L) and high available sediment-bound SRP were observed in low groundwater discharge zones, specifically in the shallow (=0.1 m) streambed sediments. Porewater SRP concentrations were linked to iron and possibly manganese redox cycling with more-reducing conditions consistently coinciding with high SRP. Porewater SRP varied temporally but distinct seasonal changes across the stream reach were not observed. A shallow oxic cap that may limit SRP release to the stream was observed in the very shallow streambed but its presence was spatially and temporally discontinuous. Finally, data indicate P-rich shallow streambed sediments are the likely source of the observed high SRP porewater concentrations in the streambed rather than incoming groundwater from the adjacent fields. Overall, the findings highlight the complexity of SRP dynamics in agricultural streambeds and provide insight into processes governing the timing and location of SRP loading streams."
651;"Seasonal precipitation pattern analysis for decision support of agricultural irrigation management in Louisiana, USA";"Clement D. Sohoulande Djebou a,* , Stacia Conger b , Ariel A. Szogi a , Kenneth C. Stone a , Jerry H. Martin a";"Rainfed agriculture is often a challenge in many humid regions due to the irregular distribution of precipitation events. Precipitation irregularity during crop growing seasons causes soil water deficits that negatively impact crop yields. To alleviate water stress, farmers are expected to compensate for water deficits through irrigation. Because irrigation consumes valuable water resources, it is critical to envision water management strategies that enhance precipitation water use and reduce irrigation water withdrawals. However, precipitation patterns generally vary depending on locations and seasons. Hence, a thorough understanding of crop exposure to water deficit in time and space is essential to improve agricultural water use efficiency. This study investigated both spatial and seasonal patterns of precipitation to elucidate the exposure of crops to water deficits at a regional scale. Specifically, a spatial regionalization technique was applied to a 33-year gridded time series of seasonal precipitation totals and numbers of events in Louisiana to determine two precipitation regions with distinct characteristics. Within each region, kernel density estimators were employed to approximate the actual probability distribution of seasonal precipitations. Estimates of crop water requirements for corn, soybean, cotton, grain sorghum, and sugarcane under both early and late planting scenarios were employed to evaluate the probabilities of crop exposure to water deficits during the growing seasons. The outcomes of this study include a distinction of precipitation regions for Louisiana and a detailed probabilistic evaluation of crops exposure to water deficits. These outcomes are intended to support irrigation management recommendations for farmers across the state of Louisiana."
652;Norms triumph over self-interest! The role of perceived values and different norms on sustainable agricultural practices;"Mingliang Wang a , Shunlong Gong a , Luyu Liang a , Li Bai b,c,* , Zhenlin Weng d , Jin Tang d,";"Environmental sustainability and public health are faced with tremendous threat caused by the agri-food system, and it has reached a consensus that the agri-food system must be transformed to be more efficient, healthy, and sustainable. Promoting farmers to implement sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) is a critical path to accelerate this transformation. This study is to understand farmers? intention to adopt Eco-breeding, a typical SAPs with Chinese characteristics and market potential, based on the perspectives of self-interested, altruistic, and social pressures, and explore how farmers make trade-offs when personal interests and norms conflict. We conducted field surveys on 600 livestock and poultry farmers and proceeded a comprehensive empirical analysis involving direct, indirect, and moderating effects tests. The results show perceived values, personal norms, and subjective norms accounted for 58.5% of the intention variance. Subjective norms are foremost predictors, and perceived values and personal norms has significant positive effects. Personal norms are mainly motivated by the awareness of consequences and ascribed responsibility. Remarkably, the results indicate that personal norms and subjective norms positively moderate the negative effects of perceived risks on intention. When these two norms exceed thresholds, the negative effects of perceived risks disappear. In addition to self-interested motives, this study highlights the importance of norms in shaping farmers? intention to adopt Eco-breeding and finally provides guidelines for designing effective promotion policy."
653;High spatio-temporal resolution evapotranspiration estimates within large agricultural fields by fusing eddy covariance and Landsat based data;"Deanroy Mbabazi a , Binayak P. Mohanty a,* , Nandita Gaur a,b";"Accurate estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) are difficult to quantify at varying spatial and temporal scales. Eddy covariance (EC) methods estimate ET at high temporal resolutions (30 min), but with little knowledge regarding its spatial variation. In contrast, remote sensing-based methods using Landsat (7 and 8) provide high spatial resolution (30 m) ET with low temporal resolution (8 to16-days for 2 concurrent Landsat platforms). In this study, we developed a new algorithm to generate high spatio-temporal (daily 30 m resolution) ET (ETFUSE) within large agricultural fields by fusing eddy covariance and Landsat ET data. ETFUSE was compared with standardized Penman-Monteith ET (ETPM) and spline interpolated alfalfa reference fraction ET (ETRF) at six sites in the Continental United States. Spatial cross-correlation (using NDVI as a covariable), EC flux footprint modeling, and a source weighted scaling relationship between EC footprints and Landsat ET were used in fusion algorithm to generate ETFUSE. Using Ameriflux and Texas Water Observatory sites as testbeds, ET dynamics were found statistically similar for ETFUSE, ETRF, and ETPM for various land covers and growing seasons. Correlation coefficients for ETFUSE compared with ETPM were 0.77?0.96 at the study sites, during the growing seasons from 2016 to 2019. RMSEs and MAEs ranged between 0.35?0.96 mm d- 1 and 0.28?0.51 mm d- 1 , respectively, for ETFUSE compared to ETPM. The ETFUSE algorithm is limited for use up to 81 km2 extents centered around EC towers. ETFUSE provides spatially variable ET, reflecting areas with low and high ET, useful in variable-rate irrigation systems for precision agriculture water management or in hydrologic models."
654;Convenient colorimetric-fluorescent dual-mode recognition of I - in agricultural products and visual determination of Hg2+ in drinking beverages using Ag-Pt bimetal quantum dot nanozyme;"Yulian Tang , Wenxin Gou, Xue Lv, Xuemei Zhou, Junkai Hao , Chengjie Sun , Tao Sun , Lei Hu * , Zhengquan Yan";"Conveniently and efficiently monitoring I - and Hg2+ in agricultural products or drinking beverages for the protection of human health is currently a great challenge. With this aim, a Ag-Pt bimetal quantum-dot nanozyme boosted by bioactive folic acid (FA@Ag-Pt QDs) was first developed for multichannel monitoring of I - and Hg2+ in this work using a two-step liquid-phase reduction method. Not only did the present FA@Ag-Pt QDs possess superior peroxidase-like activity with Michaelis constant (Km) and maximal reaction rate (Vmax) of 0.01 mM/ 2.95 ? 10- 8 M?s - 1 and 1.15 mM/3.88 ? 10- 8 M?s - 1 , respectively, trace Hg2+ or I - could exclusively alter their enzyme-mimic performance with obvious color changes from blue to colorless or dark blue. I - could also strengthen the inherent fluorescence property of FA@Ag-Pt QDs. When applied for visual monitoring of I - and Hg2+ in real beverages or iodine-containing agricultural products, the detection recoveries were 93.9 %?105.3 % and 96.8?104.3 % with low detection limits of 6.56 ? 10- 8 mol/L and 4.00 ? 10- 10 mol/L (S/N = 3), respectively. The recovery and detection limit for fluorescent detection of I - were 95.8 %?104.1 % and 1.75 ? 10- 8 mol/L (S/N = 3), respectively. The mechanisms driving the improved peroxidase-like activity of FA@Ag-Pt QDs and their selective monitoring of Hg2+ and I - were illustrated in detail. The proposed FA@Ag-Pt QDs will act as an efficient sensor for the practical multichannel monitoring of Hg2+ and I - , with superior catalytic signal amplification."
655;Automation and digitization of agriculture using artificial intelligence and internet of things;"A. Subeesh ?, C.R. Mehta";"The growing population and effect of climate change have put a huge responsibility on the agriculture sector to increase food-grain production and productivity. In most of the countries where the expansion of cropland is merely impossible, agriculture automation has become the only option and is the need of the hour. Internet of things and Artificial intelligence have already started capitalizing across all the industries including agriculture. Advancement in these digital technologies has made revolutionary changes in agriculture by providing smart systems that can monitor, control, and visualize various farm operations in real-time and with comparable intelligence of human experts. The potential applications of IoT and AI in the development of smart farm machinery, irrigation systems, weed and pest control, fertilizer application, greenhouse cultivation, storage structures, drones for plant protection, crop health monitoring, etc. are discussed in the paper. The main objective of the paper is to provide an overview of recent research in the area of digital technology-driven agriculture and identification of the most prominent applications in the field of agriculture engineering using artificial intelligence and internet of things. The research work done in the areas during the last 10 years has been reviewed from the scientific databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. It has been observed that the digitization of agriculture using AI and IoT has matured from their nascent conceptual stage and reached the execution phase. The technical details of artificial intelligence, IoT, and challenges related to the adoption of these digital technologies are also discussed. This will help in understanding how digital technologies can be integrated into agriculture practices and pave the way for the implementation of AI and IoT-based solutions in the farms."
656;A deep-understanding framework and assessment indicator system for climate-resilient agriculture;"Xuezheng Zong a,b , Xiaojie Liu a , Gang Chen c , Yunhe Yin a";"Climate change threatens agricultural production and leads to an increasing contradiction between food supply and needs. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural activities will exacerbate climate change in the future. Solving food security has become a major challenge around the world. The development of climateresilient agriculture (CRA) is critical to address or slow climate change and is also helpful to improve agricultural quality and efficiency. Based on a review of previous studies and a deep understanding of CRA goals, this paper introduced a comprehensive assessment framework to evaluate CRA. This assessment framework combined four dimensions, i.e., agricultural productivity, farmer income, climate adaptability, and the green development level, and has 71 evaluation indicators. The highlights of this framework are to analyze the impacts of climate change on agricultural development and to stress the synergy of mitigation and adaptation strategies. All indicators represent various factors related to the development of CRA and have been used in previous studies. Therefore, the comprehensive assessment framework can be used as an evaluation tool for analyzing the changes in agroecosystem resilience under climate change, which is also helpful to implement scientific management to ensure sustainable agricultural development and food security."

Nineteen different intervention scenarios were investigated to evaluate potential watershed-scale agricultural water savings and associated water budget impacts in the MRG. The interventions are based on (i) management innovations of growers in implementing deficit irrigation and changing cropping patterns using existing crops, (ii) changing cropping patterns by introducing new alternative drought- and salt-tolerant crops, and (iii) limitations of the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model to perform scenario simulations. New hydrological insights for the region: (1) status quo irrigation management cannot sustain the current crop mix in the face of dwindling river water and likely fresh groundwater depletion within the 21st century (2) existing cropping and irrigation interventions create limited water savings and (3) deficit irrigation of alfalfa or removing it from the crop mix allows moderate water savings to sustain high-value perennial pecan crops but the region will remain vulnerable to intensive, prolonged droughts. Strategies for future agricultural water sustainability in the study area could include transitioning to relatively drought- and salt-tolerant crops, desalinating brackish groundwater for irrigation, and developing water markets to increase flexibility in water use."
658;Anaerobic biogas formation from crops? agricultural residues ? Modeling investigations;"Marvin Scherzinger a,* , Martin Kaltschmitt a , Amr Y. Elbanhawy b";"The cultivation of field crops necessarily produces large quantities of organic residues, which could be used for the production of biogas. However, this is only successfully possible if the operators of such biogas plants have sufficient expertise in running these plants, e.g. to avoid an overload of the biogas system. Against this background, the anaerobic degradability of various Egyptian agricultural residues is determined by laboratory testing this includes both a determination of degradation behavior in batch tests and a feed analysis. The residues studied produce biogas yields ranging from 303 to 496 mLN gVS -1 . Co-digestion experiments demonstrate that hardly any interaction effects occur during the fermentation process for different mixtures of the investigated residues. Based on these findings, a model is developed to estimate biogas production using the investigated agricultural residues in continuous operation and to give recommendations for the optimal mode of operation."
659;Impact of global value chains on tariffs and non-tariff measures in agriculture and food;"Valentina Raimondi a,* , Andreea Piriu b , Johan Swinnen c,d , Alessandro Olper a,d";"We analyse whether global value chains (GVCs) reduce trade barriers in the agricultural and food sectors as they affect lobbying and government incentives. Political economy theory predicts that tariffs will be lower in countries integrated in GVCs and that the effect will be stronger outside regional trade agreements (RTAs). We use data from 1995 to 2015 from 160 countries on tariffs and non-tariff measures (NTMs) in the agri-food sector. Our evidence indicates that GVC integration, measured as domestic (foreign) value added in foreign (domestic) final goods, does affect trade policy. Stronger GVC integration is associated with lower tariffs, but mainly outside RTAs, and lower NTMs, both inside and outside RTAs."
660;Spatial-temporal dynamics of agricultural drought in the Loess Plateau under a changing environment: Characteristics and potential influencing factors;"Zhiming Han a , Qiang Huang a , Shengzhi Huang a,* , Guoyong Leng b , Qingjun Bai a , Hao Liang a , Lu Wang a , Jing Zhao a , Wei Fang a";"Understanding the evolution characteristics of regional drought is crucial to the sustainable development of ecology and social economy, especially in typical water-limited area. However, the exploring the spatialtemporal dynamics of agricultural drought in the Loess Plateau (LP) under global warming and regional vegetation restoration project is still insufficient, and its potential causes remain unresolved. To this end, in this study, the standardized soil moisture index (SSMI) was constructed based on the root soil moisture data of the Global Land Data Assimilation System, and their suitability in monitoring agricultural drought in the LP was evaluated. In addition, it is proposed to describe the spatial-temporal dynamics of agricultural drought with the migration of drought centroid, and to further analyze the influencing factors of agricultural drought. Results show that: (1) the response time of agricultural to meteorological drought in the LP is approximately 9 months, mainly with existence of moderate drought and drought coverage nearly 10?25%, and the probability of exceptionally drought in a short time is low (2) from 1982 to 2015, the spatial distribution of drought frequency in the LP gradually increased from southeast to northwest, and the agricultural drought in the northwest has the characteristics of frequent occurrence, short duration and weak intensity, with no significant trend of longer duration and weaker intensity (3) among the 7 droughts screened out by the Drought migration model, the migration direction of drought centroids are mainly east?west, concentrated in the middle of the LP. In the early and late stage of drought, drought migration trends to have a longer path and faster speed, while in the middle it is shorter and denser (4) significant increasing precipitation (p < 0.01) in the LP has not alleviated agricultural drought, whereas significant increasing temperature (p < 0.01) is the direct factor inducing agricultural drought, and the implementation of vegetation restoration project further aggravates the risk of agricultural drought. This study not only provides scientific guidance for agricultural drought early warning, prevention and mitigation of drought losses in the LP from the perspective of time and space, but also offers a valuable reference for understanding the impact of large-scale vegetation restoration projects."
661;Foundations of Programmable Process Structures for the unified modeling and simulation of agricultural and aquacultural systems;"Monika Varga * , Bela Csukas";"This research paper defines the theoretical foundations and computational implementation of a non-conventional modeling and simulation methodology, inspired by the needs of problem solving for biological, agricultural, aquacultural and environmental systems. The challenging practical problem is to develop a framework for automatic generation of causally right and balance-based, unified models that can also be applied for the effective coupling amongst the various (sophisticated field-specific, sensor data processing-based, upper level optimization-driven, etc.) models. The scientific problem addressed in this innovation is to develop Programmable Process Structures (PPS) by combining functional basis of systems theory, structural approach of net theory and computational principles of agent based modeling. PPS offers a novel framework for the automatic generation of easily extensible and connectible, unified models for the underlying complex systems. PPS models can be generated from one state and one transition meta-prototypes and from the transition oriented description of process structure. The models consist of unified state and transition elements. The local program containing prototype elements, derived also from the meta-prototypes, are responsible for the case-specific calculations. The integrity and consistency of PPS architecture are based on the meta-prototypes, prepared to distinguish between the conservation-laws-based measures and the signals. The simulation is based on data flows amongst the state and transition elements, as well as on the unification based data transfer between these elements and their calculating prototypes. This architecture and its AI language-based (Prolog) implementation support the integration of various field- and task-specific models, conveniently. The better understanding is helped by a simple example. The capabilities of the recently consolidated general methodology are discussed on the basis of some preliminary applications, focusing on the recently studied agricultural and aquacultural cases"
662;Humanising agricultural extension: A review;"Brian R. Cook a,? , Paula Satiz?al a , Jayne Curnow b";"Agricultural extension is booming. This interest is critical in the context of numerous pressing issues linked to agrarian change and rural development. Because of its importance, extension has attracted significant critique for its persistent exclusion of social and political factors. In this light, the history of extension can be thought of as a paradigm composed of approaches aimed at increasing agricultural production through the transfer of technologies from experts to farmers, and a series of criticisms of technology transfer as hampered by neglect of socio-political factors, a process labelled ?rendering technical?. By reviewing criticisms of extension for its rendering of socio-political factors, we account for the rendering of power, place, and people. Equally important, we offer examples that consolidate critiques in order to open the possibility that humanized extension may more successfully support farmers. Our review is an effort to engage extensionists in order to speak about power to those who attempt to speak truth to power."
663;Oil prices and agricultural growth in South Africa: A threshold analysis;"Goodness C. Aye * , Nicholas M. Odhiambo";"Oil plays a pivotal role in the growth of agriculture as a combustion lubricant for machineries and equipment used in the farming enterprise. Several studies have shown that a relationship exists between oil prices and agricultural growth without clear boundaries beyond which these prices are detrimental to the growth. Therefore, this study is conducted to identify the threshold above which oil prices will adversely affect agricultural growth in South Africa. Real West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Real Brent crude oilprices in both Dollars and Rands were used as threshold variables in the threshold regression model of agricultural growth. The findings showed that beyond the threshold values of 12.99%, 15.68%, 15.69% and 15.70%, the prices of Real WTI crude oil in Dollars, Real Brent crude oil in Dollars, Real WTI crude oil in Rands and Real Brent crude oil in Rands respectively will have significant negative effects on agricultural growth in South Africa."

Modern IoT-based smart agriculture systems use Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to gather information from an ecosystem that regulates the quantity of water in agricultural fields could be one of these activities. The WSNs remained a challenge to transfer data to drones for analysis purposes. These are composed of tiny sensory architectures organized together to bring efficiency and scalability features to a network. WSN nodes are controlled and managed by a cluster. It is quite difficult to design an efficient leader election protocol. The computation power, storage space, and energy supply of sensor nodes make them unable to frequently switch to a different cluster. The WSN cluster-head election process requires a lot of energy (evaluation and computational process to select the most appropriate node with the least impact on network fragmentation in energy consumption of selected node). Then it is necessary to formulate a mechanism where WSNs utilize the least energy to coordinate with the remote sensing sources. This study presents a cluster election algorithm using the fuzzy logic inference system. It uses a coordinates system to map network nodes and map them based on prioritized scheduling. Lifetime augmentation in wireless sensor networks has always been of great interest. During data transmission from normal sensor nodes to the base station (sink), excess energy is dissipated. Optimizing the energy dissipation of WSNs through the selection of cluster heads is a powerful way to increase the lifespan. By electing more efficient nodes as cluster heads, the proposed method extends the network?s lifetime by reducing the number of unimportant communications between nodes. With the utilization of network resources efficiently, the network?s lifetime is extended. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with the LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Structure) algorithm and FCA method based on the remaining energy and the number of active nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm utilizes less energy for communication with remote sensory equipment for intelligent agriculture. The performance of the method improved for remaining energy by 9%, the number of active nodes rate by 24%, and indirectly network resource utilization than other states of the art solutions. "
665;Experiences and challenges of agricultural development in an artificial oasis: A review;"Tianyu Wang a,b , Zhenhua Wang a,b,**, Li Guo c,* , Jinzhu Zhang a,b , Wenhao Li a,b , Huaijie He a,b , Rui Zong a,b , Dongwang Wang a,b , Zhecheng Jia a,b , Yue Wen a,b";"CONTEXT: An artificial oasis is a desert area suitable for human occupation and agriculture by human management. Agricultural reclamation in artificial oases provides a means for population growth and urban expansion in arid regions, but it comes at an environmental cost. OBJECTIVE: Xinjiang is a largely arid region in northwest China, in which agricultural cultivation is concentrated in piedmont oases. Xinjiangs agriculture expansion has placed it as the largest cotton and grape producing area in China. This study seeks to understand better the successes and challenges facing oasis agriculture and propose possible solutions. METHODS: Through field investigation, experiments, and data collection, we reviewed a typical case of agricultural development over the past 60 years in the Mosuowan irrigation area of Xinjiang. We summarized the experiences and problems that emerged and then put forward some suggestions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified four factors that are critical for successful agricultural development: (1) irrigation infrastructure and water conservancy projects (2) land consolidation (3) intensive agricultural management and (4) irrigation technology improvements. After nearly 60 years of rapid agricultural reclamation, we identified several challenges in sustainable agricultural development: (1) soil salinization (2) ecological and environmental deterioration (3) declines in economic benefits (4) and soil and environment pollution. We propose the following measures that may feasibly address these concerns, respectively: (1) comprehensively harness saline-alkali land by means of improvers, biological methods, and drainage infrastructure (2) establish desert-oasis ecological buffer zones (3) adjust agricultural management policies (4) and improve plastic recycling or degradability and adjusting irrigation and fertilization strategies to  educe soil pollution. SIGNIFICANCE: Oasis agriculture is a complex and fragile system, and its sustainable development needs to be rooted in scientific management. We hope that our review can provide some reference for agricultural development in similar areas. "

This paper constructs an evaluation index system of China?s APE from the perspective of input?output. The spatial autocorrelation model and econometric model are used to calculate the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics and influencing factors of China?s APE in 1990 and 2017. The results show that China?s APE level is relatively low, and there are significant spatial differences. The extremely high efficiency regions are distributed in the eastern plains of China the regions with extremely low efficiency are mainly distributed in the southwest and the western regions of China. The results of the spatial correlation effect show that the H-H agglomeration regions of APE are usually distributed in the eastern coastal areas and northeastern areas, while the L-L agglomeration regions are mainly distributed in the central mountainous areas and the border areas of western Yunnan. From 1990 to 2017, the influencing factors of APE have gradually changed, and showing a more complex trend, mainly including farmland management scale, multiple crop index, rural per capita net income, population density, and precipitation per unit area. Finally, the corresponding policy and suggestions are provided."

Zaller a,? , Angeliki Lyssimachou b , Peter Clausing c , Koen Hertoge d , Caroline Linhart d";"Pesticide drift onto non-agricultural land is a common problem in intensively farmed regions, and national action plans have been established across Europe to prevent it. Here, we analyzed official data on pesticide residues in grass samples collected over six years to determine whether implemented measures to reduce pesticide drift were effective. We used 306 samples collected between 2014 and 2020 on non-agricultural land in one of the most intensively managed apple and wine growing regions in Europe, the Autonomous Province of Bolzano-South Tyrol, Italy. Samples were analyzed for up to 314 substances by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Percentage of sites with multiple pesticides and number of pesticides decreased between 2014 and 2020. Fungicides were most often detected, with fluazinam found on 74 % and captan on 60 % of the contaminated sites (53 sites out of a total of 88 sites were contaminated). The most frequently found insecticide, phosmet, was detected in 49 % of the contaminated sites. Only one herbicide, oxadiazon, was detected in <1 % of the sites glyphosate was not analyzed. The percentage of residues with human hazard properties increased significantly across years regarding reproductive toxicity (from 21 % of the detected substances in 2014 to 88 % in 2020) and specific target organ toxicity (0 % in 2014 to 21 % in 2020). Percentages of substances associated with endocrine-disruption (89 % of substances across years) or carcinogenic properties (45 % of substances across years) remained constant. The percentage of sites where concentrations in grass samples exceeded the surrogate maximum residue levels (MRLs) for lettuce also remained constant. Potential ecotoxicological hazards of detected residues regarding acute contact toxicity to honeybees remained high over the study years, while the acute and chronic toxicity to earthworms decreased. Our results suggest that while drift mitigation measures contributed some reduction in pesticide contamination, they were not sufficient to eliminate substantial risks to human health and the environment in nontarget areas."
668;Post-assessment in policy-based strategic environmental assessment: Taking China?s agricultural support and protection subsidy policy as an example;"Ting Liu a , He Xu b,";"As the top-level component of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) system, policy-based strategic environmental assessment (SEA) plays an important role in avoiding the negative environmental impacts of policy implementation. However, the development of policy-based SEA in China is relatively slow due to institutional and technical difficulties. In fact, the effective inclusion of policy-based SEA in the early stage of policy decisionmaking will continue to face major and long-term practical resistance in the future, such that conducting policybased SEA on a large-scale will be difficult. Therefore, this study proposes a chain-type post-assessment framework suitable for assessing the environmental impact of policies under implementation from the perspective of policy life cycle assessment to promote policy-based SEA to cover more policies. This framework includes five parts, namely, policy analysis, impact identification, impact analysis, cause exploration, and policy recommendations. This framework follows a typical model with environmental impact analysis as the core and incorporates the concept of system optimization. Following this framework, this study conducts an EIA of China?s agricultural support and protection subsidy policy (ASPSP). The study finds that the framework demonstrated good applicability in the post-assessment of policies under implementation. In the future, to promote the establishment and development of policy-based SEA in China, work should be conducted from the following aspects: promotion of the policy EIA into law, establishment of an assessment framework throughout the policy life cycle, and strengthening the research on methods. Through case studies, this study finds that China?s ASPSP, which is beneficial to the environment in terms of policy design, lacks a prominent positive impact on the ecoenvironment and even has a negative impact. This is related not only to unreasonable policy design but also to deviation from policy implementation under the joint action of policy implementers, policy object, and the policy implementation environment. In the future, while continuing to optimize and adjust policies, work should be conducted in terms of optimizing the policy implementation environment, improving policy implementation methods, and strengthening the foundation of policy implementation to improve policy effectiveness."
669;Generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image augmentation in agriculture: A systematic review;"Yuzhen Lu a,* , Dong Chen b,1 , Ebenezer Olaniyi a,1 , Yanbo Huang c";"In agricultural image analysis, optimal model performance is keenly pursued for better fulfilling visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, segmentation, object detection and localization), in the presence of challenges with biological variability and unstructured environments. Large-scale, balanced and ground-truthed image datasets are tremendously beneficial but most often difficult to obtain to fuel the development of highly performant models. As artificial intelligence through deep learning is impacting analysis and modeling of agricultural images, image augmentation plays a crucial role in boosting model performance while reducing manual efforts for image collection and labelling, by algorithmically creating and expanding datasets. Beyond traditional data augmentation techniques, generative adversarial network (GAN) invented in 2014 in the computer vision community, provides a suite of novel approaches that can learn good data representations and generate highly realistic samples. Since 2017, there has been a growth of research into GANs for image augmentation or synthesis in agriculture for improved model performance. This paper presents an overview of the evolution of GAN architectures followed by a first systematic review of various applications in agriculture and food systems (https://github.com/Derekabc/GANs-Agriculture), involving a diversity of visual recognition tasks for plant health conditions, weeds, fruits (preharvest), aquaculture, animal farming, plant phenotyping as well as postharvest detection of fruit defects. Challenges and opportunities of GANs are discussed for future research."
670;Potential of mathematical model-based decision making to promote sustainable performance of agriculture in developing countries: A review article;"Meselu Tegenie Mellaku a,* , Ashebir Sidelil Sebsibe b";"In developing countries like Ethiopia, agriculture takes the leading role in the economy and enhancing the efficiency of agriculture resource decision making remains essential to eradicate extreme poverty through promoting sustainable agricultural production. Recent economic growth efforts in agriculture dependent economies are aggravating to further natural resource degradation, environmental pollution, and climate change. One of the main challenges is the use of inefficient conventional land use decision-making. Conventional land use decision making refers to the practice of traditional land use decision-making, which is inefficient to capture spatial and temporal land use decision dynamics and trade-offs. This paper reviewed existing literatures on decision-making models in agriculture targeting to document the potential of mathematical model-based decision making to enhance the sustainable performance of agriculture in developing countries compared to the existing conventional agricultural practice decision approach. From over 400 literatures collected from the Google Scholar search engine 63 articles were selected for the synthesis. The literatures were screened through inclusion and exclusion criteria. Literatures that used any mathematical model as a decision support tool in agriculture and related sectors, included a clear description of the model type, aim of the study, the key attribute characterizing the application of the model, decision support system, and output were included in the review. The synthesis result uncovered that with varying degrees of impact, flexibility, and complexity, mathematical model-based land use decision making has greater potential to enhance sustainable performance of agriculture and resource use efficiency in developing countries."

Here, we propose an operational monitoring system based on Sentinel2 surface reflectance (SR) data and machine learning (ML) algorithms, consisting of a hierarchical approach triggering 3 color-coded warning alerts to distinguish among compliant (green), non-compliant (red), and inconclusive (yellow) parcels comparatively to the farmer?s declaration. A Random Forest (RF) model is applied to a 5-day interpolated SR time series to generate a preliminary crop map, where all the parcels whose predicted and declared crop type match are flagged as compliant. Next, a refinement procedure is adopted to improve the discrimination between temporary and permanent crops. At this stage, VI temporal metrics and texture are used as input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained using only the previous compliant parcels. Through a set of decision rules, SVM crop class predictions are flagged as compliant, non-compliant and inconclusive. The system was tested for a significant area in mainland Portugal, using the 2019 Land Parcel Information System (LPIS) data. The system returned 96.5%, 2.5% and 1% of the parcels as compliant, inconclusive, and noncompliant, respectively. Comparison with field inspections for the subsidy control of 2019 revealed that only 1.1% of the correct declarations were classified by the system as non-compliant (5% as admissible value), while less than 5% of the real non-compliant declarations passed through the system (10?20%)."
672;Constrained temperature and relative humidity predictive control: Agricultural greenhouse case of study;"Hafsa Hamidane * , Samira EL Faiz, Iliass Rkik, Mohamed El Khayat, Mohammed Guerbaoui, Abdelali Ed-Dahhak, Abdeslam Lachhab";"The importance of Model Predictive Control (MPC) has significant applications in the agricultural industry, more specifically for greenhouse?s control tasks. However, the complexity of the greenhouse and its limited prior knowledge prevent an exact mathematical description of the system. Subspace methods provide a promising solution to this issue through their capacity to identify the system?s comportment using the fit between model output and observed data. In this paper, we introduce an application of Constrained Model Predictive Control (CMPC) for a greenhouse temperature and relative humidity. For this purpose, two Multi Input Single Output (MISO) systems, using Numerical Subspace State Space System Identification (N4SID) algorithm, are firstly suggested to identify the temperature and the relative humidity comportment to heating and ventilation actions. In this sense, linear state space models were adopted in order to evaluate the robustness of the control strategy. Once the system is identified, the MPC technique is applied for the temperature and the humidity regulation. Simulation results show that the regulation of the temperature and the relative humidity under constraints was guaranteed, both parameters respect the ranges 15 C  Tint  30 C and 50 %  Hint  70 % respectively. On the other hand, the control signals uf and uh applied to the fan and the heater, respect the hard constraints notion, the control signals for the fan and the heater did not exceed 0  uf  4.3 Volts and 0  uh  5 Volts, respectively, which proves the effectiveness of the MPC and the tracking tasks. Moreover, we show that with the proposed technique, using a new optimization toolbox, the computational complexity has been significantly reduced. The greenhouse in question is devoted to Schefflera Arboricola cultivation."

676;Influencing factors of farmers? adoption of pro-environmental agricultural technologies in China: Meta-analysis;"Hualin Xie a,b,* , Yingqian Huang a";"As one of the main focuses of agricultural development research, changes in agricultural technology are a dynamic reflection of the economic environment. This paper uses the Meta-analysis method to conduct a comprehensive analysis of 77 empirical studies to reveal the influence factors, sources of heterogeneity, and influence effects of farmers on the adoption behavior of pro-environmental agricultural technology over time. The results show the following: (1) Influencing factors of farmer?s pro-environmental agricultural technology adoption behavior are not completely homogeneous. Among the factors, age, farming population, family income, farm income ratio, number of plots, and land transfer have a regulating effect. Most of the observed heterogeneity relates to the research areas, funding levels and models used. (2) Age, off-farm income ratio, and land fragmentation have a significantly negative impact on farmers? adoption of pro-environmental agricultural technologies. We find no impact on household size, farming population, and village cadres. Farm income ratio, farmland protection policy awareness, land transfer, and government subsidies have significantly positive effects. (3) Over time, only land transfer has a significantly positive impact on the adoption of pro-environmental agricultural technologies by farmers, and the impact has gradually increased. The farming population, technical understanding, and number of plots have no significant impact, but their effects have weakened to varying degrees. Therefore, policymakers and other stakeholders need to consider geographical differences and farming systems, the technology needs of different farmers and affordable costs, in addition to focusing on common variables, when designing policies to encourage the adoption of agricultural technologies in China.

677;Total and dissolved phosphorus losses from agricultural headwater streams during extreme runoff events;"C.A. Ross a,? , L.L. Moslenko a , K.M. Biagi a , C.J. Oswald a , C.C. Wellen a , J.L. Thomas b , M. Raby b , R.J. Sorichetti b";"Eutrophication continues to be a concerning global water quality issue. Managing and mitigating harmful algal blooms demands clear information on the conditions promoting large phosphorus losses from contributing watersheds. Of particular concern is the amount and form of phosphorus loading to receiving water bodies during extreme runoff events, which are expected to increase in frequency due to climate change. Five years (2015 to 2020) of water quantity and quality data from 11 agricultural watersheds in the lower Great Lakes basin were analyzed and used to model total and dissolved phosphorus losses. This study aimed to assess temporal dynamics in phosphorus concentrations and losses over runoff events covering a wide range of hydrologic conditions and to quantify their relative importance on annual phosphorus losses. Event concentration-discharge relationships for total and dissolved phosphorus were hysteretic and had contrasting dominant patterns across watersheds. The proportion of annual phosphorus losses during events was highly variable between watersheds, accounting for 47?94 %. Extreme events were particularly impactful: as few as three events per year were found to be responsible for nearly half of total phosphorus (20?50 %) and total dissolved phosphorus (14?44 %) losses. Variability in total and dissolved phosphorus losses and concentrations over a wide range of flow conditions suggests that event magnitude is an important control on the relative mobility of particulate and dissolved phosphorus fractions. This study showed that insights into nutrient dynamics and phosphorus budgets in the lower Great Lakes basin and agriculture dominated environments more broadly can be gained by assessing event nutrient losses with respect to flow conditions and patterns in concentration-discharge relationships."
678;Norms triumph over self-interest! The role of perceived values and different norms on sustainable agricultural practices;"Mingliang Wang a , Shunlong Gong a , Luyu Liang a , Li Bai b,c,* , Zhenlin Weng d , Jin Tang d,";"Environmental sustainability and public health are faced with tremendous threat caused by the agri-food system, and it has reached a consensus that the agri-food system must be transformed to be more efficient, healthy, and sustainable. Promoting farmers to implement sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) is a critical path to accelerate this transformation. This study is to understand farmers? intention to adopt Eco-breeding, a typical SAPs with Chinese characteristics and market potential, based on the perspectives of self-interested, altruistic, and social pressures, and explore how farmers make trade-offs when personal interests and norms conflict. We conducted field surveys on 600 livestock and poultry farmers and proceeded a comprehensive empirical analysis involving direct, indirect, and moderating effects tests. The results show perceived values, personal norms, and subjective norms accounted for 58.5% of the intention variance. Subjective norms are foremost predictors, and perceived values and personal norms has significant positive effects. Personal norms are mainly motivated by the awareness of consequences and ascribed responsibility. Remarkably, the results indicate that personal norms and subjective norms positively moderate the negative effects of perceived risks on intention. When these two norms exceed thresholds, the negative effects of perceived risks disappear. In addition to self-interested motives, this study highlights the importance of norms in shaping farmers? intention to adopt Eco-breeding and finally provides guidelines for designing effective promotion policy."

680;Potential of mathematical model-based decision making to promote sustainable performance of agriculture in developing countries: A review article;"Meselu Tegenie Mellaku a,* , Ashebir Sidelil Sebsibe b";"In developing countries like Ethiopia, agriculture takes the leading role in the economy and enhancing the efficiency of agriculture resource decision making remains essential to eradicate extreme poverty through promoting sustainable agricultural production. Recent economic growth efforts in agriculture dependent economies are aggravating to further natural resource degradation, environmental pollution, and climate change. One of the main challenges is the use of inefficient conventional land use decision-making. Conventional land use decision making refers to the practice of traditional land use decision-making, which is inefficient to capture spatial and temporal land use decision dynamics and trade-offs. This paper reviewed existing literatures on decision-making models in agriculture targeting to document the potential of mathematical model-based decision making to enhance the sustainable performance of agriculture in developing countries compared to the existing conventional agricultural practice decision approach. From over 400 literatures collected from the Google Scholar search engine 63 articles were selected for the synthesis. The literatures were screened through inclusion and exclusion criteria. Literatures that used any mathematical model as a decision support tool in agriculture and related sectors, included a clear description of the model type, aim of the study, the key attribute characterizing the application of the model, decision support system, and output were included in the review. The synthesis result uncovered that with varying degrees of impact, flexibility, and complexity, mathematical model-based land use decision making has greater potential to enhance sustainable performance of agriculture and resource use efficiency in developing countries."
681;Convenient colorimetric-fluorescent dual-mode recognition of I - in agricultural products and visual determination of Hg2+ in drinking beverages using Ag-Pt bimetal quantum dot nanozyme;"Yulian Tang , Wenxin Gou, Xue Lv, Xuemei Zhou, Junkai Hao , Chengjie Sun , Tao Sun , Lei Hu * , Zhengquan Yan";"Conveniently and efficiently monitoring I - and Hg2+ in agricultural products or drinking beverages for the protection of human health is currently a great challenge. With this aim, a Ag-Pt bimetal quantum-dot nanozyme boosted by bioactive folic acid (FA@Ag-Pt QDs) was first developed for multichannel monitoring of I - and Hg2+ in this work using a two-step liquid-phase reduction method. Not only did the present FA@Ag-Pt QDs possess superior peroxidase-like activity with Michaelis constant (Km) and maximal reaction rate (Vmax) of 0.01 mM/ 2.95 ? 10- 8 M?s - 1 and 1.15 mM/3.88 ? 10- 8 M?s - 1 , respectively, trace Hg2+ or I - could exclusively alter their enzyme-mimic performance with obvious color changes from blue to colorless or dark blue. I - could also strengthen the inherent fluorescence property of FA@Ag-Pt QDs. When applied for visual monitoring of I - and Hg2+ in real beverages or iodine-containing agricultural products, the detection recoveries were 93.9 %?105.3 % and 96.8?104.3 % with low detection limits of 6.56 ? 10- 8 mol/L and 4.00 ? 10- 10 mol/L (S/N = 3), respectively. The recovery and detection limit for fluorescent detection of I - were 95.8 %?104.1 % and 1.75 ? 10- 8 mol/L (S/N = 3), respectively. The mechanisms driving the improved peroxidase-like activity of FA@Ag-Pt QDs and their selective monitoring of Hg2+ and I - were illustrated in detail. The proposed FA@Ag-Pt QDs will act as an efficient sensor for the practical multichannel monitoring of Hg2+ and I - , with superior catalytic signal amplification."

Zaller a,? , Angeliki Lyssimachou b , Peter Clausing c , Koen Hertoge d , Caroline Linhart d";"Pesticide drift onto non-agricultural land is a common problem in intensively farmed regions, and national action plans have been established across Europe to prevent it. Here, we analyzed official data on pesticide residues in grass samples collected over six years to determine whether implemented measures to reduce pesticide drift were effective. We used 306 samples collected between 2014 and 2020 on non-agricultural land in one of the most intensively managed apple and wine growing regions in Europe, the Autonomous Province of Bolzano-South Tyrol, Italy. Samples were analyzed for up to 314 substances by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Percentage of sites with multiple pesticides and number of pesticides decreased between 2014 and 2020. Fungicides were most often detected, with fluazinam found on 74 % and captan on 60 % of the contaminated sites (53 sites out of a total of 88 sites were contaminated). The most frequently found insecticide, phosmet, was detected in 49 % of the contaminated sites. Only one herbicide, oxadiazon, was detected in <1 % of the sites glyphosate was not analyzed. The percentage of residues with human hazard properties increased significantly across years regarding reproductive toxicity (from 21 % of the detected substances in 2014 to 88 % in 2020) and specific target organ toxicity (0 % in 2014 to 21 % in 2020). Percentages of substances associated with endocrine-disruption (89 % of substances across years) or carcinogenic properties (45 % of substances across years) remained constant. The percentage of sites where concentrations in grass samples exceeded the surrogate maximum residue levels (MRLs) for lettuce also remained constant. Potential ecotoxicological hazards of detected residues regarding acute contact toxicity to honeybees remained high over the study years, while the acute and chronic toxicity to earthworms decreased. Our results suggest that while drift mitigation measures contributed some reduction in pesticide contamination, they were not sufficient to eliminate substantial risks to human health and the environment in nontarget areas."
683;Generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image augmentation in agriculture: A systematic review;"Yuzhen Lu a,* , Dong Chen b,1 , Ebenezer Olaniyi a,1 , Yanbo Huang c";"In agricultural image analysis, optimal model performance is keenly pursued for better fulfilling visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, segmentation, object detection and localization), in the presence of challenges with biological variability and unstructured environments. Large-scale, balanced and ground-truthed image datasets are tremendously beneficial but most often difficult to obtain to fuel the development of highly performant models. As artificial intelligence through deep learning is impacting analysis and modeling of agricultural images, image augmentation plays a crucial role in boosting model performance while reducing manual efforts for image collection and labelling, by algorithmically creating and expanding datasets. Beyond traditional data augmentation techniques, generative adversarial network (GAN) invented in 2014 in the computer vision community, provides a suite of novel approaches that can learn good data representations and generate highly realistic samples. Since 2017, there has been a growth of research into GANs for image augmentation or synthesis in agriculture for improved model performance. This paper presents an overview of the evolution of GAN architectures followed by a first systematic review of various applications in agriculture and food systems (https://github.com/Derekabc/GANs-Agriculture), involving a diversity of visual recognition tasks for plant health conditions, weeds, fruits (preharvest), aquaculture, animal farming, plant phenotyping as well as postharvest detection of fruit defects. Challenges and opportunities of GANs are discussed for future research."

This paper constructs an evaluation index system of China?s APE from the perspective of input?output. The spatial autocorrelation model and econometric model are used to calculate the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics and influencing factors of China?s APE in 1990 and 2017. The results show that China?s APE level is relatively low, and there are significant spatial differences. The extremely high efficiency regions are distributed in the eastern plains of China the regions with extremely low efficiency are mainly distributed in the southwest and the western regions of China. The results of the spatial correlation effect show that the H-H agglomeration regions of APE are usually distributed in the eastern coastal areas and northeastern areas, while the L-L agglomeration regions are mainly distributed in the central mountainous areas and the border areas of western Yunnan. From 1990 to 2017, the influencing factors of APE have gradually changed, and showing a more complex trend, mainly including farmland management scale, multiple crop index, rural per capita net income, population density, and precipitation per unit area. Finally, the corresponding policy and suggestions are provided."
685;Exploring the use of phytoremediation and sustainable methods of agriculture in alleviating the pollution in the uThongathi river estuary;"Loshini Pillaya,* , Fannie Machete a , Rodney Hart b";"Introduction and Aim: The uThongathi Estuary was found to be in a poor ecological state and the water pollution was due to the discharge from the wastewater treatment plant, industrial, agricultural and residential sectors of Tongaat. The aims of this paper were therefore to explore the need for phytoremediation, as well as to show the importance of sustainable methods of agriculture in alleviating the pollution in the uThongathi River Estuary. Materials and Methods: The research method chosen was a triangulation procedure and this involved experiments, questionnaires and observations. The experiments involved phytoremediation using artificial miniature wetlands and soil samples taken from the estuary. The plants used in the miniature wetlands were Chrysopogon zizanioides, Polystichum pungen and Polystichum munitum, whereasthe plants used in phytoremediation of soil were the Spinacia oleracea L and Helianthus annuus. Questionnaires were given to all sectors of Tongaat and people were chosen randomly using The Yamane, 1967 approach with an error margin of 6%. Results: The results revealed that phytoremediation can be used successfully to reduce water pollution and eliminate the odour of bacteria coliform and nitrates. The Polystichum pungen was able to reduce the bacterial coliform from 2900 to 100 cfu/ mL. The use of the sustainable methods of mixed cropping or intercropping can reduce pests and prevent the use of harmful pesticides and herbicides and low tillage or non-tillage is good for the quality of the soil. Biopesticides can be used as an alternative to conventional pesticides. Conclusions: The overall outcome of the study showed that phytoremediation and sustainable agricultural methods can successfully alleviate pollution in the uThongathi Estuary"
686;Oil prices and agricultural growth in South Africa: A threshold analysis;"Goodness C. Aye * , Nicholas M.

Several studies have shown that a relationship exists between oil prices and agricultural growth without clear boundaries beyond which these prices are detrimental to the growth. Therefore, this study is conducted to identify the threshold above which oil prices will adversely affect agricultural growth in South Africa. Real West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Real Brent crude oilprices in both Dollars and Rands were used as threshold variables in the threshold regression model of agricultural growth. The findings showed that beyond the threshold values of 12.99%, 15.68%, 15.69% and 15.70%, the prices of Real WTI crude oil in Dollars, Real Brent crude oil in Dollars, Real WTI crude oil in Rands and Real Brent crude oil in Rands respectively will have significant negative effects on agricultural growth in South Africa."
687;Spatiotemporal characterization of agricultural drought in the Sahel region using a composite drought index;"Zakari Seybou Abdourahamane a,* , Issa Garba a , Aboubakr Gambo Boukary a,b , Alisher Mirzabaev c";"A composite drought index (CDI) was developed for seasonal drought monitoring at 1 km2 resolution over the West African Sahel (WAS). The CDI was derived from remote sensing data, mainly, the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) from the Terra/MODIS satellite. The weights of these input variables were estimated using a combined entropy method and weighted Euclidian distance. The CHIRPS resulted with the highest weight (mean = 0.74) followed by the NDVI (mean = 0.243) and the LST (mean = 0.016). The CDI was found to be well correlated with the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)?computed from station data. However, the CDI showed a better sensitivity for drought detection following a comparison of drought classes. The suitability of the CDI for agricultural drought monitoring was validated by its good correlation with crop production data, namely maize, millet and sorghum with a Pearson r in the range of 0.29?0.56, 0.40?0.81 and 0.57?0.71, respectively. Finally, a drought database was generated for the WAS, enabling the extraction of drought characteristics at a given location using its geographic coordinates."

Nineteen different intervention scenarios were investigated to evaluate potential watershed-scale agricultural water savings and associated water budget impacts in the MRG. The interventions are based on (i) management innovations of growers in implementing deficit irrigation and changing cropping patterns using existing crops, (ii) changing cropping patterns by introducing new alternative drought- and salt-tolerant crops, and (iii) limitations of the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model to perform scenario simulations. New hydrological insights for the region: (1) status quo irrigation management cannot sustain the current crop mix in the face of dwindling river water and likely fresh groundwater depletion within the 21st century (2) existing cropping and irrigation interventions create limited water savings and (3) deficit irrigation of alfalfa or removing it from the crop mix allows moderate water savings to sustain high-value perennial pecan crops but the region will remain vulnerable to intensive, prolonged droughts. Strategies for future agricultural water sustainability in the study area could include transitioning to relatively drought- and salt-tolerant crops, desalinating brackish groundwater for irrigation, and developing water markets to increase flexibility in water use."

Modern IoT-based smart agriculture systems use Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to gather information from an ecosystem that regulates the quantity of water in agricultural fields could be one of these activities. The WSNs remained a challenge to transfer data to drones for analysis purposes. These are composed of tiny sensory architectures organized together to bring efficiency and scalability features to a network. WSN nodes are controlled and managed by a cluster. It is quite difficult to design an efficient leader election protocol. The computation power, storage space, and energy supply of sensor nodes make them unable to frequently switch to a different cluster. The WSN cluster-head election process requires a lot of energy (evaluation and computational process to select the most appropriate node with the least impact on network fragmentation in energy consumption of selected node). Then it is necessary to formulate a mechanism where WSNs utilize the least energy to coordinate with the remote sensing sources. This study presents a cluster election algorithm using the fuzzy logic inference system. It uses a coordinates system to map network nodes and map them based on prioritized scheduling. Lifetime augmentation in wireless sensor networks has always been of great interest. During data transmission from normal sensor nodes to the base station (sink), excess energy is dissipated. Optimizing the energy dissipation of WSNs through the selection of cluster heads is a powerful way to increase the lifespan. By electing more efficient nodes as cluster heads, the proposed method extends the network?s lifetime by reducing the number of unimportant communications between nodes. With the utilization of network resources efficiently, the network?s lifetime is extended. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with the LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Structure) algorithm and FCA method based on the remaining energy and the number of active nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm utilizes less energy for communication with remote sensory equipment for intelligent agriculture. The performance of the method improved for remaining energy by 9%, the number of active nodes rate by 24%, and indirectly network resource utilization than other states of the art solutions. "

692;Nitrate removal mechanism in riparian groundwater in an intensified agricultural catchment;"Zheyu Xie, Yujing Zhang, Zhenyu Zhang, Jinliang Huang";"Nitrate contamination in ground and surface water is a persistent problem in agricultural countries. The transition zone between rivers and riparian aquifers plays an important role in mediating riverine nitrate export, as it promotes intensive denitrification, resulting in permanent nitrate removal from aquatic systems. However, the underlying mechanisms controlling riparian denitrification are not well understood. In this study, we present an assessment of water chemistry and isotope data from a two-year river and groundwater sampling period along a coastal watershed in Southeast China. The results showed that the highest oxygen depletion and denitrification rates in the riparian aquifer occurred in the infiltrated river proportions with higher groundwater temperatures. Heterotrophic microbial responses in the riparian zone may have been driven by bioavailable organic carbon from the river water in the riparian aquifer. For the underlying processes of NO3 - removal efficiency from riparian groundwater, the additional processes substantially surpassed denitrification (mean of 12.1% vs. 6.6%), particularly at the furthest distance from the river in winter. The mean proportional contribution of manure and sewage (54.5%) was the highest for nitrate contamination, followed by soil N fertilizer (23.7%), chemical fertilization (18.5%), and atmospheric deposition (3.3%). This study provides valuable guidance for agricultural water management based on the key finding that high connectivity between rivers and groundwater might improve the NO3 - removal potential."

The analysis includes the importance of four main drivers (climate, land use, agricultural practices, and biogeophysical properties of catchments), each divided into different factors that may influence stream NO3 - loads during three subperiods defined by the time of introduction of different mitigation measures: i) 1990?1998, ii) 1999?2007, and iii) 2008?2018. Significant correlations with annual flow-weighted stream NO3 - concentrations and/or loads were found for factors representing all of the four main drivers including precipitation, large scale climate fluctuations, runoff, previous years runoff, baseflow index, number of annual frost days, agricultural area, livestock density, field N surplus, catch crop cover, manure storage capacity, method and time of manure spreading, and time of soil tillage. Changes in the four drivers were reflected by the load-runoff (L-Q) relationships for each of the three subperiods within each of the five headwater catchments. The five catchments experienced large but catchment-specific downward shifts in the L-Q relationship attributable to changes in land use and agricultural management within the catchments. The documented large downward shifts in NO3 - loads demonstrated for the five catchments (30?52%) as a consequence of mandatory regulation over a period of nearly three decades are a unique example of how agriculture can reduce its environmental impact."
694;Identifying nitrate sources and transformations in an agricultural watershed in Northeast China: Insights from multiple isotopes;"Yao Wu a , Hanyu Ju a , Hao Jiang b , Guangxin Zhang a,* , Peng Qi a,**, Zan Li a";"Accurate identification of riverine nitrate sources is required for preventing and controlling nitrogen contamination in agricultural watersheds. The water chemistry and multiple stable isotopes (d15N?NO3, d18O?NO3, d2 H?H2O, and d18O?H2O) of the river water and groundwater in an agricultural watershed in China?s northeast black soil region were analyzed to better understand the sources and transformations of riverine nitrogen. Results showed that nitrate is an important pollutant that affects water quality in this watershed. Affected by factors such as seasonal rainfall changes and spatial differences in land use, the nitrate concentrations in the river water showed obvious temporal and spatial variations. The riverine nitrate concentration was higher in the wet season than in the dry season, and higher downstream than upstream. The water chemistry and dual nitrate isotopes revealed that riverine nitrate came primarily from manure and sewage (M&S). Results from the SIAR model showed that it accounted for more than 40% of riverine nitrate in the dry season. The proportional contribution of M&S decreased during the wet season due to the increased contribution of chemical fertilizers and soil nitrogen induced by large amounts of rainfall. The d2 H?H2O and d18O?H2O signatures implied that interactions occurred between the river water and groundwater. Considering the large accumulation of nitrates in the groundwater, restoring groundwater nitrate levels is essential for controlling riverine nitrate pollution. As a systematic study on the sources, migration, and transformations of nitrate/nitrogen in agricultural watersheds in black soil regions, this research can provide a scientific support for nitrate pollution management in the Xinlicheng Reservoir watershed and provide a reference for other watersheds in black soil regions in the world with similar conditions."
695;Study on agricultural cultivation development layout based on the matching characteristic of water and land resources in North China Plain;"Guiyu Yang a,b,* , Shuoyang Li a,b , Hao Wang a,b , Lin Wang a,b";"The North China Plain is the main producing area of winter wheat in China. Due to the relatively poor condition of water resources, the competition of water between industry and agriculture is fierce. The increasing shortage of water resources has led to serious overexploitation of groundwater in some areas. Agricultural development is faced with severe challenges. In order to ensure regional food security and sustainable winter wheat planting, 52 cities of North China Plain (NCP), in the following of the paper, use the shorted name NCP,were taken as research units to analyze the matching characteristics of agricultural water and land resources, so as to reveal the direction of irrigated agriculture development and winter wheat suitable planting layout considering their balance in future. The paper firstly analyzed the cultivated area determined by water resource and irrigation development by agricultural available water, and then pointed out the direction of water-suited planting layout of winter wheat. The results showed that: 1) the Gini coefficient showed an increasing trend, which indicated that the area of cultivated land and irrigation area supported by water resources have nearly reached the upper limit. The large-scale extension of both cultivated and irrigation area is impossible under the restriction of water. 2) The amount of agricultural available water resources per unit of effective irrigation area and the effective precipitation increased gradually from north to south in the NCP, but the spatial distribution of water requirement of winter wheat in its growth period changed in the opposite way. This indicated the poor spatiotemporal match between winter wheat planting and water resources, leading to the cost of spending more water to maintain wheat production. 3), The further development of irrigation and the water-suited planting of winter wheat should pay attention to the southern part of the plain with rich water (such as southern Henan Province, Jiangsu Province, Anhui Province, etc.) to ensure the regional agricultural development. That is of great significance to the regional sustainable development, water shortage alleviation and national grain safety."
696;Diverse agricultural landscapes increase bat activity and diversity: Implications for biological pest control;"Axelle Tortosa a,* , Brice Giffard b , Luc Barbaro a,c , J?er?emy S.P. Froidevaux c,d , Sylvie Ladet a , Jeanne Delhommel a , Aude Vialatte a";"Diverse landscapes consisting of mixed crops are expected to support higher biological control, while also contributing to maintain farmland biodiversity. Although bats are known as predators of many farming pests, few studies to date have investigated how their foraging activity may enhance natural pest control. Here, we tested the hypothesis that crop mosaics would provide a temporal continuity in prey availability for bats, ultimately resulting in higher biological control. We sampled bat activity and diversity, and the abundance and damage of three major pests of vineyards, maize, and pine plantations, in both simple and diverse landscapes mixing the three production types. Bat species richness and total activity were higher in vineyards and pine plantations located within diverse landscapes. Bat foraging activity also peaked within diverse landscapes. In vineyards, moth abundance decreased with bat species richness. In pine plantations, pest damage decreased with bat foraging activity. In maize fields, pest abundance and damage increased with bat richness and activity longerterm investigations would be necessary to assess their actual effectiveness. Our study advocates for promoting a diversity of coexisting crops within agricultural landscapes to enhance bat activity and diversity, which in turn would sustain higher biological control and bolster biodiversity conservation in farmland."
697;Constrained temperature and relative humidity predictive control: Agricultural greenhouse case of study;"Hafsa Hamidane * , Samira EL Faiz, Iliass Rkik, Mohamed El Khayat, Mohammed Guerbaoui, Abdelali Ed-Dahhak, Abdeslam Lachhab";"The importance of Model Predictive Control (MPC) has significant applications in the agricultural industry, more specifically for greenhouse?s control tasks. However, the complexity of the greenhouse and its limited prior knowledge prevent an exact mathematical description of the system. Subspace methods provide a promising solution to this issue through their capacity to identify the system?s comportment using the fit between model output and observed data. In this paper, we introduce an application of Constrained Model Predictive Control (CMPC) for a greenhouse temperature and relative humidity. For this purpose, two Multi Input Single Output (MISO) systems, using Numerical Subspace State Space System Identification (N4SID) algorithm, are firstly suggested to identify the temperature and the relative humidity comportment to heating and ventilation actions. In this sense, linear state space models were adopted in order to evaluate the robustness of the control strategy. Once the system is identified, the MPC technique is applied for the temperature and the humidity regulation. Simulation results show that the regulation of the temperature and the relative humidity under constraints was guaranteed, both parameters respect the ranges 15 C  Tint  30 C and 50 %  Hint  70 % respectively. On the other hand, the control signals uf and uh applied to the fan and the heater, respect the hard constraints notion, the control signals for the fan and the heater did not exceed 0  uf  4.3 Volts and 0  uh  5 Volts, respectively, which proves the effectiveness of the MPC and the tracking tasks. Moreover, we show that with the proposed technique, using a new optimization toolbox, the computational complexity has been significantly reduced. The greenhouse in question is devoted to Schefflera Arboricola cultivation."
698;Visco-elastic-plastic model to represent the compression behaviour of sugarcane agricultural residue;"Joyner Caicedo-Zuniga ~ a , Fernando Casanova a,* , Jose Jaime Garci?a b";"The objective was to develop a visco-elastic-plastic model for the prediction and characterisation of the compaction behaviour of sugarcane agricultural residues during the production of bales under different moisture contents (27%, 37% and 48%) and different particle sizes (~300 mm, 150 mm and 80 mm). Data of confined-compaction and stress relaxation experiments were used to calibrate the model parameters. The proposed constitutive equation was composed of a generalised Maxwell model with three branches in series with a plastic component. The procedure was developed to characterise model parameters and used a numeric approach to calculate the hereditary integral when fitting the experimental curves, whilst the stress due to the plastic strains was fitted with a polynomial. The model provided good accuracy (R2 > 0.92) to fit the compaction and relaxation stages with the same set of parameters. Thus, it predicted the energy required to produce bales as well as the final relaxed density of this sustainable material that may become an important source of energy."

This review intends to summarize the possible scheme through coupling chemical conversion of crop straws to biochar and biological conversion of livestock waste to value-added products thus reaching key nutrient circulation. Chemical conversion of crop straws to biochar was reviewed through summarizing the preparation methods and functional modification of biochar. Then, high-solid two-phase anaerobic conversion of agriculture bio-waste to valueadded products and improved performance of bio-conversion through byproduct gases reuse and biochar supplementation were reviewed. Finally, high quality compost production through amendment of biochar and residual digestate was proposed with analysis of reduced nitrogen emission and carbon balance. The biological mechanism of synergistic regulation of carbon and nitrogen loss during bio-conversion with biochar was also reviewed. This will provide a model for synergistic conversion of agricultural wastes to value added products pursuing key nutrient circulation."
700;Post-assessment in policy-based strategic environmental assessment: Taking China?s agricultural support and protection subsidy policy as an example;"Ting Liu a , He Xu b";"As the top-level component of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) system, policy-based strategic environmental assessment (SEA) plays an important role in avoiding the negative environmental impacts of policy implementation. However, the development of policy-based SEA in China is relatively slow due to institutional and technical difficulties. In fact, the effective inclusion of policy-based SEA in the early stage of policy decisionmaking will continue to face major and long-term practical resistance in the future, such that conducting policybased SEA on a large-scale will be difficult. Therefore, this study proposes a chain-type post-assessment framework suitable for assessing the environmental impact of policies under implementation from the perspective of policy life cycle assessment to promote policy-based SEA to cover more policies. This framework includes five parts, namely, policy analysis, impact identification, impact analysis, cause exploration, and policy recommendations. This framework follows a typical model with environmental impact analysis as the core and incorporates the concept of system optimization. Following this framework, this study conducts an EIA of China?s agricultural support and protection subsidy policy (ASPSP). The study finds that the framework demonstrated good applicability in the post-assessment of policies under implementation. In the future, to promote the establishment and development of policy-based SEA in China, work should be conducted from the following aspects: promotion of the policy EIA into law, establishment of an assessment framework throughout the policy life cycle, and strengthening the research on methods. Through case studies, this study finds that China?s ASPSP, which is beneficial to the environment in terms of policy design, lacks a prominent positive impact on the ecoenvironment and even has a negative impact. This is related not only to unreasonable policy design but also to deviation from policy implementation under the joint action of policy implementers, policy object, and the policy implementation environment. In the future, while continuing to optimize and adjust policies, work should be conducted in terms of optimizing the policy implementation environment, improving policy implementation methods, and strengthening the foundation of policy implementation to improve policy effectiveness."
701;Urbanization and agricultural land loss in India: Comparing satellite estimates with census data;"Bhartendu Pandey* , Karen C. Seto";"We examine the impacts of urbanization on agricultural land loss in India from 2001 to 2010. We combined a hierarchical classification approach with econometric time series analysis to reconstruct land-cover change histories using time series MODIS 250 m VI images composited at 16-day intervals and night time lights (NTL) data. We compared estimates of agricultural land loss using satellite data with agricultural census data. Our analysis highlights six key results. First, agricultural land loss is occurring around smaller cities more than around bigger cities. Second, from 2001 to 2010, each state lost less than 1% of its total geographical area due to agriculture to urban expansion. Third, the northeastern states experienced the least amount of agricultural land loss. Fourth, agricultural land loss is largely in states and districts which have a larger number of operational or approved SEZs. Fifth, urban conversion of agricultural land is concentrated in a few districts and states with high rates of economic growth. Sixth, agricultural land loss is predominantly in states with higher agricultural land suitability compared to other states. Although the total area of agricultural land lost to urban expansion has been relatively low, our results show that since 2006, the amount of agricultural land converted has been increasing steadily. Given that the preponderance of Indias urban population growth has yet to occur, the results suggest an increase in the conversion of agricultural land going into the future."

Moreno Pallares a , Fausto A. Canales c , A. Corrales Paternina d , A. Echeverr?-Gonz?ez e";"Access to agricultural services promotes agricultural production and livelihoods of smallholders in most developing countries. The purpose of this study was to analyze the socioeconomic determinants that influence the application of agricultural practices in peasant families in northern Colombia. Categorical and numerical variables of demographic information were evaluated at 200 Agricultural Production Units (APU) in the five prioritized municipalities. With the data obtained, multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed. The results indicated heterogeneity in terms of farmer cooperative, socioeconomic factors and agricultural practices. The study found that education level, income from agriculture, farmer cooperative and credit were determinant factors for most of the agricultural practices that were considered. The results also indicate that non-agricultural income did not influence household well-being. It was found that extension services in the area of the study are insufficient and that farmers face difficulties in having access to credit and loans. Understanding of these factors is essential for the formulation and implementation of intervention strategies aimed at improving the quality of life of these communities, and to preserve and manage human, social, agricultural and financial capital."
705;"Linkages between soil organic matter and magnetic mineral formation in agricultural fields in southeastern Minnesota, USA";"Aaron L. Frankl a,b,* , Daniel P. Maxbauer a , Mary E. Savina a";"Magnetic properties of soil are widely utilized to study soil development in a variety of settings due to the formation of strongly magnetic iron oxides during pedogenesis. Similarly, soil organic matter (SOM) is commonly measured in soil surveys conducted on agricultural lands due to the essential role SOM plays in the soil ecosystem. Here, we present data from two agricultural fields in southeastern Minnesota that demonstrate a relationship between soil magnetic properties and SOM. In each field, we collected 100 topsoil samples along a 40 m by 20 m grid to determine spatial variability in soil magnetic properties and SOM, as well as two soil cores to constrain variability with depth (~0?60 cm). Magnetic susceptibility, low-field remanence, and hysteresis properties were used to characterize magnetic mineral abundance and grain-size in the soils. There are strong positive correlations between SOM and three magnetic properties: the frequency dependence of susceptibility (?fd), anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM), and the ratio of ARM to isothermal remanent magnetization (ARM/IRM). All three of these magnetic properties (?fd, ARM, and ARM/IRM) are sensitive to the concentration (or relative abundance) of fine-grained (<75 nm) magnetite/maghemite known to form in well-drained soils during pedogenesis. Correlation between SOM and magnetic properties persist in each field despite differences in the management strategy over the past three decades. Our results support a functional link between SOM and soil-formed magnetite/maghemite, where increasing SOM (up to a threshold) enhances the production and stability of soil-formed magnetite due to its role in soil redox processes and iron-organic complexes. Agricultural soils seem particularly well suited to demonstrate correlations between SOM and pedogenic magnetic minerals due to their relatively low SOM and typically well-drained environments, supporting the utility of soil magnetism in agricultural soil survey studies."

Thomas b , M. Raby b , R.J. Sorichetti b";"Eutrophication continues to be a concerning global water quality issue. Managing and mitigating harmful algal blooms demands clear information on the conditions promoting large phosphorus losses from contributing watersheds. Of particular concern is the amount and form of phosphorus loading to receiving water bodies during extreme runoff events, which are expected to increase in frequency due to climate change. Five years (2015 to 2020) of water quantity and quality data from 11 agricultural watersheds in the lower Great Lakes basin were analyzed and used to model total and dissolved phosphorus losses. This study aimed to assess temporal dynamics in phosphorus concentrations and losses over runoff events covering a wide range of hydrologic conditions and to quantify their relative importance on annual phosphorus losses. Event concentration-discharge relationships for total and dissolved phosphorus were hysteretic and had contrasting dominant patterns across watersheds. The proportion of annual phosphorus losses during events was highly variable between watersheds, accounting for 47?94 %. Extreme events were particularly impactful: as few as three events per year were found to be responsible for nearly half of total phosphorus (20?50 %) and total dissolved phosphorus (14?44 %) losses. Variability in total and dissolved phosphorus losses and concentrations over a wide range of flow conditions suggests that event magnitude is an important control on the relative mobility of particulate and dissolved phosphorus fractions. This study showed that insights into nutrient dynamics and phosphorus budgets in the lower Great Lakes basin and agriculture dominated environments more broadly can be gained by assessing event nutrient losses with respect to flow conditions and patterns in concentration-discharge relationships."
707;Decomposition of climate-induced productivity growth in Indian agriculture;"Souryabrata Mohapatraa,* , Basil Sharpa , Auro Kumar Sahoo b , Dukhabandhu Sahooc";"This paper adopts a stochastic frontier approach to investigate the trend and determinants of total factor productivity (TFP) growth in the agriculture sector of India, using extensive district-level data. The assessment of the production frontier highlights the efficiency aspect of Indian agriculture and contributes to an analysis of those factors that might be directly engaged in the production process. After controlling for the district-specific climatic effect in the production of eighteen major crops, TFP growth is deconstructed into technical progress, technical efficiency change and scale effects. Four weather parameters, average temperature, rainfall, evapotranspiration and windspeed, are defined as exogenous determinants of the technical inefficiency term to analyze the influence of changing climate. Based on the true fixed effect model and maximum likelihood method, the estimated TFP growth averaged 0.688% per year between 1990 and 2015. The relative performance of Indian states apparently differs according to estimated productivity scores. The findings show that changes in technical efficiency account for most TFP growth, whereas differences in scale components account for annual and cross-state productivity growth disparities. The study suggests that region-specific policies are required to enhance agricultural productivity and add to the understanding of the arguments over TFP growth in Indian agriculture."

Such complexes aggravate the difficulties in agricultural water, land, and fertilizer resources optimization. To address the above problems, this paper developed the spatially-distributed ANNmulti-objective multi-preference fuzzy credibility constrained programming (distributed ANN-MOMPFCCP) for optimizing water, land, and fertilizer resources. It incorporates the multi-objective programming (MOP), multipreferences credibility constrained programming (MPFCCP) with the distributed ANN model, and has obvious advantages in improving the calculation efficiency of the traditional spatially-distributed crop simulationoptimization model. Besides, it can address uncertainties of the crop simulation model by introducing stochastic programming. It builds connections between food yields and agricultural ecological effects by introducing negative and positive ecological benefits in study system. Through proposed model, optimal distributed schemes considering spatial heterogeneous net economic and ecological benefit, and associated integrated risks can be generated. Optimal results show that water shortage risk occupied about 20 % of total risks, economic and ecological loss occupied about 20~20.2 % and 20~21 % of total economic and ecological benefits, respectively. Considering uncertainties of crop simulation model was a high effective way to improve robustness of simulation model. The model could offer insight alternatives for regional managers in measuring distributed agriculturalecological benefit as well as making tradeoff among economic, ecological benefits and risks. Moreover, this approach can help manage multi-type resources under uncertainties, and provide multiple groups of Pareto solutions for managers, so that managers could select best management practices based on respective risk attitudes, and preferences."

Reyes Molina a,b,* , Seonghyun Park a , Sunkyu Park a , Stephen S.

Biomass-based biochars produced during fast pyrolysis process is introduced as alternative precursors to produce AC and the integrated process for the co-production of porous adsorbent materials from biochar via the fast pyrolysis process is suggested. Moderate surface areas and good adsorption capacities were obtained from switchgrass (SWG) and pine tops (PT) based AC. The surface areas were 959 and 714 m2 /g for SWG- and PT-based AC, respectively. The adsorption capacities using toluene as pollutant for two model systems of 180 and 300 ppm were measured and ranged between 441- 711 and 432?716 mg/g for SWG-based and PT-based AC, respectively. The nitrogen adsorptive behavior, Lagergren pseudo-second-order kinetic (PSOK) model and kinetics isotherms studies describe a heterogeneous porous system, including a mesoporous fraction with the existence of a multilayer adsorption performance. The presence of micropores and mesopores in SWG- and PTbased AC suggests potential commercial applications for using pyrolytic biochars for AC production."

711;Farmer-centred design: An affordances-based framework for identifying processes that facilitate farmers as co-designers in addressing complex agricultural challenges;"C.R. Eastwood a,* , F.J. Turner a , A.J. Romera a,b";"CONTEXT: Structured co-design processes are increasingly used for agricultural system redesign challenges. Many co-design processes were created in non-agricultural contexts, therefore there has been limited analysis of how they are best applied when involving farmers in co-design. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this paper are to describe the application and affordances of co-design processes in a context of complex agricultural problems, and to build understanding on the use of such approaches with farmer stakeholders. METHODS: We examine co-design affordances through two case studies: using Reflexive Interactive Design for future farm system redesign, and Design Thinking for farming workplace redesign. Data collection involved surveys and phone interviews of co-design participants, notes from project team observations and reflections, and direct farmer participant feedback. We critically evaluated the co-design processes using an affordances-based analytical framework. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Co-design methods can enable researchers to engage with farmers and other agricultural stakeholders to address major agricultural redesign challenges. However, farmers are not always comfortable with highly analytical methods used in some co-design processes. Through the two case studies analysed in this paper, we propose the concept of farmer-centred design, where effective inclusion of farmers in design processes is achieved by selecting the co-design approaches used based on the affordances they provide farmer participants. Processes based on structural affordances (harnessing and aggregating) may frustrate farmer co-designers, while second-order functional affordances, such as exploration, visioning, and extending, can provide better alignment with farmer cognitive processes. SIGNIFICANCE: This novel study describes the affordances of co-design tools and proposes an adapted framework for analysing affordances. The framework will benefit researchers when determining the co-design approach that matches their redesign challenge. "

714;"Sustainable agriculture through perennial grains: Wheat, rice, maize, and other species. A review";"Diego Soto-Gomez ? a,* , Paula P?erez-Rodr?uez b";"Grain crops are an important part of the human diet, accounting for a third of the consumed calories. Throughout human history, annual grain crops with high yields have been obtained through domestication. However, the ?annual? characteristic brings associated a series of economic and environmental disadvantages, such as soil erosion or low soil resources use, that can be solved if the agriculture of annual varieties evolves towards perenniality. For this reason, there are numerous research groups dedicated to study and obtain perennial varieties of the most cultivated grain crops. In this review article, we have summarized the most important advances related to the subject, focusing on the domestication and hybridization of the most productive grains globally: wheat, rice, maize, rye and sorghum. We highlight their benefits for sustainable agriculture worldwide due to perennial grains may contribute to reducing erosion, acting avoiding carbon losses, reducing nutrient losses to waters or capturing nutrients deeper in soil when they are scarce, reducing farm costs and thus, increasing the effectiveness of agricultural grain crops. Despite perennial grain crops having disadvantages, they possess outstanding characteristics which make them resilient crops to deal with the imminent climate change. However, maintaining the perenniality trait without reducing genetic biodiversity is a great challenge of current scientific importance that must be deeply considered."

However, treated urine showed higher concentration of macronutrients compared to fertilizer recipes found in literature, and therefore needed to be diluted with increasing amount of greywater to match either N or P concentration. Accordingly, P deficiencies in the plants or excessive N concentration were found in the final wastewater-based NS. Future research is highly recommended to assess the quality of plants grown in BIA systems as well as the possible content of harmful viruses and bacteria in the harvested produce."
716;Affordances and agricultural technology;Dominic Glover;"This paper discusses how the theory of affordances can be used to investigate how a spectrum of opportunities, benefits, costs and risks is generated and unevenly distributed by different kinds of technology (where ?technology? is understood as techniques, processes and practices of doing and making, rather than technical artefacts and systems). Affordances are possibilities for action, which arise from relations between humans and entities that surround them. This paper discusses three kinds of affordances: material, cultural and socio-economic. The theory of affordances offers a coherent way to explain why different technologies have different implications, and why those implications vary for different stakeholders. Applied to the domain of development-oriented agricultural research and innovation, the theory of affordances could be used by researchers and practitioners to examine the differentiated implications of different kinds of farming technology and alternative programmes of technological change in agriculture, both ex ante (e.g. in their design, development and implementation) and ex post (e.g. in their evaluation). To illustrate the argument, the paper uses the example of weeding in the System of Rice Intensification. Since affordances in theory are generated relationally and situationally for each person, the full array of implications arising from the introduction of new technology could be wide and diverse. A practical challenge, therefore, is whether and how the theory of affordances can be used practically and operationally to design, implement and evaluate the appropriateness, accessibility, utility and value of agricultural technology and technological change for specific people and groups of interest."
717;Oriented conversion of agricultural bio-waste to value-added products - A schematic review towards key nutrient circulation;"Liheng Ren 1 , Xiaoliang Kong 1 , Jian Su , Danyang Zhao , Wenjian Dong , Chunmiao Liu , Chao Liu , Lin Luo , Binghua Yan";"Agriculture bio-waste is one of the largest sectors for nutrient circulation and resource recovery. This review intends to summarize the possible scheme through coupling chemical conversion of crop straws to biochar and biological conversion of livestock waste to value-added products thus reaching key nutrient circulation. Chemical conversion of crop straws to biochar was reviewed through summarizing the preparation methods and functional modification of biochar. Then, high-solid two-phase anaerobic conversion of agriculture bio-waste to valueadded products and improved performance of bio-conversion through byproduct gases reuse and biochar supplementation were reviewed. Finally, high quality compost production through amendment of biochar and residual digestate was proposed with analysis of reduced nitrogen emission and carbon balance. The biological mechanism of synergistic regulation of carbon and nitrogen loss during bio-conversion with biochar was also reviewed. This will provide a model for synergistic conversion of agricultural wastes to value added products pursuing key nutrient circulation."
718;"Evaluation capacity building in response to the agricultural research impact agenda: Emerging insights from Ireland, Catalonia (Spain), New Zealand, and Uruguay";"James A Turner a,* , Bouali Guesmi c , Jos?e M. Gil c , Kevin Heanue d , Miguel Sierra e , Helen Percy b , Isabel Bortagaray e,f , Nour Chams c,h , Cath Milne g";"Performance-based funding and calls for public-funded science to demonstrate societal impact are encouraging public research organisations to evaluate impact, the so-called impact agenda. This paper explores evaluation methods of four fully or partially public-funded agricultural research organisations and how they are building evaluative capacity to respond to the impact agenda. Drawing on cross-organisational comparison of the readiness of each organisation to implement evaluation, the implications for improving evaluative capacity building (ECB) are discussed. This study extends the current literature on ECB, as very little has focussed on research organisations in general, and particularly agricultural research. Driven by the impact agenda, the organisations are beginning to emphasise summative evaluation. Organisational leaders valuing the demonstration of impact and commitment to building evaluation capacity are important precursors to other aspects of organisational readiness to implement evaluation. However, organisational emphasis remains on using evaluation for accountability and to improve efficiency and allocation of funding. The organisations have yet to systematically embed evaluation processes and capabilities for learning at programme and organisation-levels. There is, therefore, an opportunity to develop organisation and programme-level evaluation processes that inform each other and the pathways to impact from science. To realise this opportunity, organisations could strengthen internal and external networks of evaluation practitioners and academics to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of monitoring and evaluation for learning (MEL) and to begin to reshape organisational culture by using evaluation methods that are grounded in co-production and integrated scientific and societal values."
719;"Long and short-term trends of stream hydrochemistry and high frequency surveys as indicators of the influence of climate change, agricultural practices and internal processes (Aurade agricultural catchment, SW France)";"Vivien Ponnou-Delaffona , Anne Probsta,? , Virginie Payre-Suca , Franck Granouillaca , Sylvain Ferranta,b , Anne-Sophie Perrina,c , Jean-Luc Probst";"The hydrochemical time series of stream water from a cultivated catchment were investigated at different time scales and survey frequencies. A 35-year time series of nitrate concentration and discharge, a 15-year time series of major elements and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were analysed from a yearly to a daily/ hourly basis during discharge recession after storm event periods, to determine the origin of elements, the time trends and the main controlling factors of the trends. A significant decrease over time of nitrate, base cations and other major anions was observed. These trends were controlled by agricultural practice changes (decrease of N -fertiliser input, grass-band set up) and discharge increase, especially in the last years of the period. On the other hand, K and DOC increased over the 15-year period. This increase might result from both 1) organic matter eroded from the soil surface by runoff during flood events and 2) an increase in mineralisation with increasing temperature. Seasonal variations and nycthemeral cycles indicated either calcite precipitation and nitrification processes and/or evapotranspiration, water and/or vegetation uptake during the day with increasing temperature. This paper highlights that the hydrochemical parameters measured at various time scales and frequencies can be used as powerful indicators of catchment internal processes, and of changes in agricultural management and climate change. Particularly, the multivariate high-resolution survey has shown its ability to evidence very tenuous processes not detectable by discrete sampling. The recent observed changes in hydrology argue for the need to continue the hydrochemical survey over decades."
720;Ammonia emissions from agriculture and their contribution to fine particulate matter: A review of implications for human health;"Katie E. Wyer a,* , David B. Kelleghan b , Victoria Blanes-Vidal c , Gther Schauberger d , Thomas P. Curran a";"Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) released from agriculture is contributing significantly to acidification and atmospheric NH3 may have on human health is much less readily available. The potential direct impact of NH3 on the health of the general public is under-represented in scientific literature, though there have been several studies which indicate that NH3 has a direct effect on the respiratory health of those who handle livestock. These health impacts can include a reduced lung function, irritation to the throat and eyes, and increased coughing and phlegm expulsion. More recent studies have indicated that agricultural NH3 may directly influence the early onset of asthma in young children. In addition to the potential direct impact of ammonia, it is also a substantial contributor to the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) fraction (namely the US and Europe) where it accounts for the formation of 30% and 50% of all PM2.5 respectively. PM2.5 has the ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and cause long term illnesses such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Hence, PM2.5 causes economic losses which equate to billions of dollars (US) to the global economy annually. Both premature deaths associated with the health impacts from PM2.5 and economic losses could be mitigated with a reduction in NH3 emissions resulting from agriculture. As agriculture contributes to more than 81% of all global NH3 emissions, it is imperative that food production does not come at a cost to the world?s ability to breathe where reductions in NH3 emissions can be easier to achieve than other associated pollutants."
721;"Response of honeybee colony size to flower strips in agricultural landscapes depends on areal proportion, spatial distribution and plant composition";"Franziska Baden-B?ohma,b, *, Jan Thielea,b , Jens Daubera,b";"We investigated the effects of the areal proportion, spatial distribution and plant composition (quality) of flower strips in agricultural landscapes on the size of honeybee colonies using individual-based models (BEESCOUT, BEEHAVE). For this purpose, we developed 25 landscape scenarios for an intensively used landscape (3 ? 3 km) in Havelland (Brandenburg, Germany). In the scenarios, we varied areal proportion (0.221.04%), distribution (clustered vs. even) and quality (high vs. low pollen and nectar supply) of flower strips. Then, we simulated the response of honeybee colony size to the landscape scenarios over twelve years with 100 repetitions per scenario. Colony size increased with increasing areal proportion and more even distribution of flower strips. However, this was only true for flower strips of high quality, whereas low-quality flower strips did not benefit the honeybee colonies. Our approach can help to pinpoint optimal quality, areal proportion and distribution of additional food sources for honeybees provided by flower strips in agricultural landscapes."
722;Cloud and distributed architectures for data management in agriculture 4.0 : Review and future trends;"Olivier Debauche a,b,c,? , Sa Mahmoudi a , Pierre Manneback a , Fr??ic Lebeau b,c";"The Agriculture 4.0, also called Smart Agriculture or Smart Farming, is at the origin of the production of a huge amount of data that must be collected, stored, and processed in a very short time. Processing this massive quantity of data needs to use specific infrastructure that use adapted IoT architectures. Our review offers a comparative panorama of Central Cloud, Distributed Cloud Architectures, Collaborative Computing Strategies, and new trends used in the context of Agriculture 4.0. In this review, we try to answer 4 research questions: (1) Which storage and processing architectures are best suited to Agriculture 4.0 applications and respond to its peculiarities? (2) Can generic architectures meet the needs of Agriculture 4.0 application cases? (3) What are the horizontal development possibilities that allow the transition from research to industrialization? (4) What are the vertical valuations possibilities to move from algorithms trained in the cloud to embedded or stand-alone products? For this, we compare architectures with 8 criteria (User Proximity, Latency & Jitter, Network stability, high throughput, Reliability, Scalability, Cost Effectiveness, Maintainability), and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each of them."
723;Study on spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of flood and drought disaster impacts on agriculture in China;"Xinjian Guan, Yawen Zang, Yu Meng * , Yuan Liu, Hong Lv, Denghua Yan";"Floods and droughts can reduce agricultural production and affect food security. Therefore, it is necessary to study the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of the impacts of flood and drought disasters (FDD) on agriculture. Based on the affected and destroyed rate of crops, the paper put forward a comprehensive index of FDD and combined multi-methods to analyze disaster spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and causes of FDD on agriculture in China. The results indicated the following: (1) The impact of droughts on crops was significantly higher than that of floods both temporally and spatially. In addition, the impacts of FDD on agriculture showed an overall downward trend from 1978 to 2018. (2) As for spatial distribution, the impact of floods on agriculture was mostly concentrated in Southwest, Central-south and East China, droughts mainly concentrated in Northeast, Northwest and North China, and both the impact of droughts and floods were serious in Northeast China. (3) The gravity center transfer paths of FDD impact on agriculture were opposite, the flood disaster gravity centers shifted to the southwest and northeast, while the droughts were to the northeast and southwest. (4) The positive impacts of human activities on crop losses caused by floods were mainly distributed in Southern China, and as for droughts was in most areas of Northwest, Southwest, Central-south and North China. The research results are expected to provide practical value for agricultural management and efficient governance of FDD."
724;A site-specific indicator of nitrogen loads into surface waters from conventional and conservation agriculture practices: Bayesian network model;"Artur Radomyski a,* , Roman Ashauer a,b";"Agriculture is one of the main sources of diffuse pollution, such as fertilisers, plant protection products, solid particles or pathogens. The short- and long-term impact of agriculture on surface water quality is often driven by on-farm decisions as to what practices are used to manage weeds. Farming practices can affect numerous processes such as surface runoff and soil erosion which mediate release and transport of potential pollutants to edgeof-field water courses. Excessive nitrogen emissions are an ongoing problem of many farmlands, leading to pollution of surface water bodies and causing adverse outcomes such as eutrophication, resulting in deteriorating water quality. We developed a Bayesian Network (BN) model to predict nitrogen load into surface waters at the farm level using site specific characteristics such as landscape, soil, cropping system and, also, to compare different conventional and conservation agriculture practices. The BN was built from well-established and accepted models i.e., surface runoff by water is based on the Curve Number method (CN), the soil erosion rate is calculated with the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), and nitrogen load is calculated based on a multilevel model, where the CN and the USLE outputs are used as inputs. All three sub-models produced satisfactory spread around 1:1 line. A classification technique was applied to evaluate predicted nitrogen loads against the reference data from the US EPA STEPL model with respect to nitrogen load threshold values. Out of all the data simulated with the BN 83 % agree with the reference model for the 20 kg/(ha ? yr) nitrogen load threshold, and 97 % agree when the threshold is set to the middle of the prediction range, 100 kg/(ha ? yr). The modelling exercise was performed on two pedo-climatic scenarios differing in their potential to generate surface runoff water and by considering the effect of combining three farming practices and two generic groups of crops on emitted nitrogen loads expressed as the Grey Water Footprint (GWF). Sensitivity analysis shows high importance of weather inputs for surface runoff, and topographic information for soil erosion, whereas agricultural treatments were ranked as less important. Under variable precipitation no-till practice would result in reducing emissions of water, soil and nitrogen compared to conventional farming. The results indicate that no-till practice would reduce nitrogen loads on sites with varying risk of runoff, and that a combination of no-till and small grain crops provides the best benefit in reducing nitrogen emissions. We demonstrate that a Baye?s net is a useful, flexible tool for data and knowledge assimilation and a practical approach to test and compare effects of various agricultural interventions on pollutant emissions from a farming system."
725;"Does circular bioeconomy contain singular social science research questions, especially regarding agriculture ? industry nexus?";Gaan Girard;"As the notion of circular bioeconomy emerges and the issue of organic waste recovery becomes more important, we show that circular bioeconomy is not a simple superposition of two pre-existing concepts (i.e. bioeconomy and circular economy). To do so, we have reviewed 65 scientific articles to extract the singularities of the treated theme, the valorization of organic waste. At the end of this work, we reveal that the circular bioeconomy carries within it a new specific set of questions such as: How can we create an accurate functional and in-time cascade of waste valorization happen? How to combine territorial and value chain approaches in order to analyze the organizational and technological challenges raised by the deployment of the cascading recovery of organic waste? Wouldn?t the decentralization of public policies linked to the mobilization of biomass allow better management of organic waste closer to the constraints and opportunities of each territory? What does the emergence of the circular bioeconomy change in the organization of the agricultural sector, and under what conditions would this change be profitable?"
726;The spatially-distributed ANN-optimization approach for water-agriculture-ecology nexus management under uncertainties and risks;"Youzhi Wang a,b,* , Xinwei Guo a,b , Fan Zhang c , Huijuan Yin a,b , Ping Guo d , Wenge Zhang a,b , Qiangkun Li a,b";"water-agricultural-ecology nexus system has spatial heterogeneous characteristics owing to heterogeneities of soil, crop, and weather types. Such complexes aggravate the difficulties in agricultural water, land, and fertilizer resources optimization. To address the above problems, this paper developed the spatially-distributed ANNmulti-objective multi-preference fuzzy credibility constrained programming (distributed ANN-MOMPFCCP) for optimizing water, land, and fertilizer resources. It incorporates the multi-objective programming (MOP), multipreferences credibility constrained programming (MPFCCP) with the distributed ANN model, and has obvious advantages in improving the calculation efficiency of the traditional spatially-distributed crop simulationoptimization model. Besides, it can address uncertainties of the crop simulation model by introducing stochastic programming. It builds connections between food yields and agricultural ecological effects by introducing negative and positive ecological benefits in study system. Through proposed model, optimal distributed schemes considering spatial heterogeneous net economic and ecological benefit, and associated integrated risks can be generated. Optimal results show that water shortage risk occupied about 20 % of total risks, economic and ecological loss occupied about 20~20.2 % and 20~21 % of total economic and ecological benefits, respectively. Considering uncertainties of crop simulation model was a high effective way to improve robustness of simulation model. The model could offer insight alternatives for regional managers in measuring distributed agriculturalecological benefit as well as making tradeoff among economic, ecological benefits and risks. Moreover, this approach can help manage multi-type resources under uncertainties, and provide multiple groups of Pareto solutions for managers, so that managers could select best management practices based on respective risk attitudes, and preferences."
727;Blockchain-Enabled Smart Agricultural Knowledge Discovery System using Edge Computing;"U Sakthia *, J DafniRose";"Blockchain empowered agricultural knowledge discovery system provides the secured environment for the people to store and exchange agricultural data. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain technology, and edge computing supports the agricultural fields to increase crop productivity and reduce the usage of natural resources. The smart decision support system provides efficient data management to the farmer to make the best decision to increase crop productivity and profit. In the agriculture field, different sensors and devices collect different data about the land then it can be sent to the server in the cloud environment. These data are highly sensitive and need to be securely stored and protected against unauthorized access. The farmers can communicate with the intelligent decision support system using the mobile app and web applications to get information about the land from domain experts. The proposed system used blockchain technology to provide privacy, security, easy accessibility, and availability of information to the people to use natural resources effectively and reduce the effect of soil and water pollution by using pesticides and fertilizer based on data stored in the knowledge base. We have implemented a knowledge discovery system using the platform hyperledger for efficient storage and sharing of sensor data which provides security and data privacy. Precision agriculture with IoT and Edge computing allows people and devices to be connected anywhere, anytime in a smart cloud environment to provide intelligent service to the farmers."
728;Co-creative media: Capacity building with participatory communication to adopt good agricultural standards practice for people?s health;"Panida Jongsuksomsakul a,* , Kevin Roebl b";"The World Health Organization (WHO) has used communication methods to promote the international ban of the agricultural pesticides paraquat, glyphosate and chlorpyrifos. This ban has led to misunderstanding among farmers who still use these chemicals, which may be available under different brand names. Communication with the non-scientific community is uncertain leading to miscommunication, especially where scientific language is used. Governments have banned the use of these agricultural chemicals. The scientific arguments are not necessarily understood by famers so they may ignore the prohibition and continue using them or other similar chemicals. This study uses story-telling and qualitative research methods where a questionnaire is combined with the content analytical technique. The quantitative research method was used to collect data in the field where 351 participants took part. Participatory action research is a method where community farmers engaged in selfreflection on the impact of chemicals on their fields, their health and the health of others. Their understanding of the non-chemical usage model and good agricultural practice farmers in the vicinity, especially as they were personally involved in the creation of the media from script preparation, to acting, filming, and evaluating the final docu-dramas. The findings of the docu?drama programmes of 5 GAP farmers are presented to identify the perception of how to avoid using chemicals and their solutions for tangerine farmers through a manual that is the media output from the project and the resulting findings suggesting that the factors related to the effectiveness of scientific communication are divided into pull factors and push factors."
729;"Examining the efficiency and herding behavior of commodity markets using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. Empirical evidence from energy, agriculture, and metal markets";"Bilal Ahmed Memon a,* , Hongxing Yao b , Hafiz Muhammad Naveed b";"We examine the efficiency and herding behavior between four energy markets (Crude, Brent, Gasoline, and Natural gas), five agriculture markets (Corn, Wheat, Soybeans, Cocoa, and Coffee), and three metal markets (Gold, Silver, and Copper) using multifractal detrended fluctuation method. In addition to the full sample, the analysis also uses two most critical sub-periods of GFC 2007-09 and COVID-19 to reveal hidden features and herding patterns of the commodity markets. The results indicate existence of strong multifractality patterns and resultant inefficiency with varied degrees in the commodity markets. We find highest inefficiency in the copper market, followed by silver market. While cocoa remains most efficient commodity market during the entire period of study. In addition, energy markets remain more efficient compared to the rest of the two groups. Furthermore, the results confirm that crises events impact the efficiency of commodity markets significantly, and persistence behavior with a trace of herding is found in some of the markets. Whereas, silver and gold serve as useful hedging instruments during the crises. Our study is useful for risk management, regulatory supervision, and effective decision making for investors related to investments in the commodity markets."
730;Territorial differences in agricultural investments co-financed by the European Union in Poland;"Arkadiusz Sadowski*, Monika Malgorzata Wojcieszak-Zbierska, Patrycja Beba";"This paper identifies the relationship between an active use of EU investment support programs by Polish farmers, on one side, and the local conditions for socioeconomic development and natural and structural characteristics of agriculture, on the other. The research was illustrated by the example of Poland, a country with a remarkably fragmented and territorially heterogeneous agrarian structure. This study was carried out at commune level, and used a series of variables to describe the socioeconomic development levels of communes, natural conditions for farming and the agrarian structure. These characteristics were compared with the farmers? activity in accessing EU funds allocated to farm modernization. The Hellwig?s synthetic development indicator was used to represent complex phenomena. A strong relationship was found to exist between the implementation of co-financed investments and the agrarian structure at local level. Other factors proved to be insignificant. This suggests that the agricultural development path is somewhat independent from socioeconomic and environmental conditions."
731;"Impacts of agricultural topdressing practices on cyanobacterial bloom phenology in an early eutrophic plateau Lake, China";"Shangbo Yang a , Xiaoling Chen a , Jianzhong Lu a,* , Xuejiao Hou b , Wenkai Li a , Qiangqiang Xu a";"Agricultural practices-induced pollution runoff has been widely acknowledged to be a significant source of nutrients fueling cyanobacterial bloom. The impact of topdressing activities on cyanobacterial bloom phenology (key parameters for depicting bloom process), however, has not been verified. Taking Lake Erhai, a typical eutrophic plateau lake, as an example, this study explored the spatio-temporal characteristics of phenological metrics and coverage extent for surface cyanobacterial bloom, based on phycocyanin pigment series retrieved from satellite and investigated the bloom responses to environmental forces. The results showed that higher intensity and earlier onset bloom with a larger coverage extent mainly occurred in the northern region. We identified three distinct cyanobacterial bloom growth patterns with large inter-annual variability in their bloom initiation timing (BIT). The earlier BIT is highly linked to elevated total nitrogen level and decreased wind speed. The bloom amplitude is mainly related to summer TN in 2003?2011, while associated with winter TN/TP ratio (TN, total nitrogen TP, total phosphorus) during 2016?2019. Additionally, we found direct evidence linking agricultural topdressing and the BIT of a typical autumn bloom. After one week for the topdressing practice, the BITs lagged by approximately average 23 days, coinciding with high rainfall intensity. Our research demonstrates the topdressing activity should be reduced through agricultural planting adjustments. High TN and TP loss crops should be prohibited planting adjustments should decrease high TP loss crop plantings in response to regional environmental forces."
732;How decadal predictions entered the climate services arena: an example from the agriculture sector;"Balakrishnan Solaraju-Murali a,* , Dragana Bojovic a , Nube Gonzalez-Reviriego a , Andria Nicodemou a , Marta Terrado a , Louis-Philippe Caron a,b , Francisco J. Doblas-Reyes a,c";"Predicting the variations in climate for the coming 1?10 years is of great interest for decision makers, as this time horizon coincides with the strategic planning of stakeholders from climate-vulnerable sectors such as agriculture. This study attempts to illustrate the potential value of decadal predictions in the development of climate services by establishing interactions and collaboration with stakeholders concerned with food production and security. Building on our experience from interacting with users and the increased understanding of their needs gathered over the years through our participation in various European activities and initiatives, we developed a decadal forecast product that provides tailored and user-friendly information about multi-year dry conditions for the coming five years over global wheat harvesting regions. This study revealed that the coproduction approach, where the interaction between the user and climate service provider is established at an early stage of forecast product development, is a fundamental step to successfully provide useful and ultimately actionable information to the interested stakeholders. The study also provides insights that shed light on the reasons for the delayed entry of decadal predictions in the climate services discourse and practice, obtained from surveying climate scientists and discussing with decadal prediction experts. Finally, it shows the key challenges that this new source of climate information still faces."

Severe water shortage has been threatening and limiting sustainable development in the region over the past decades. Previous studies have reported the depleted water resources in the NCR and attributed the major driver to intensified agricultural water use, hardly considering the effects of the large-scale implementation of ecological restoration (ER) programs. As terrestrial water storage (TWS) is a critical indicator for measuring and evaluating regional water resources, understanding its spatial and temporal dynamics and responses to ER programs is significant for sustainable water management in the NCR. Here, we examine the interannual variations and trends of TWS in the NCR during 2002?2016 by using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data and the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. We find the significantly (p < 0.01) decreasing TWS (-8.9 mm/yr) and identify a hotspot with the most rapid depletion (-12.7?0.45 mm/yr) in the western NCR, where interannual variations and spatial patterns of TWS depletion are consistent with those of ER-induced greening. Attribution analyses of TWS depletion by considering precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff suggest increasing evapotranspiration induced by afforestation as the major driver for TWS depletion in the ER regions. Our study highlights ER is posing a new threat to water security in the NCR, and taking ecological water usage into account would be necessary for the synergy of food, water, and ecological securities and regional sustainable development."
734;Preference Characteristics on Consumers? Online Consumption of Fresh Agricultural Products under the Outbreak of COVID-19: An Analysis of Online Review Data Based on LDA Model;"Chaorun Xiea , Xiaolong Tianb , Xiaochun Fenga *, Xiaoni Zhanga *, Junhu Ruana";"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, China has adopted a zero-clearing policy under closed control. It is rather common for residents who are quarantined at home to buy fresh agricultural products online, when COVID-19 spread in big cities. Many e-commerce platforms are trying to develop online shopping channels for fresh agricultural products. However, negative comments and news about those platforms have been increasing because of several reasons, such as the difference in the quality of fresh products, inadequate categories of commodity and inefficient delivery caused by the shortage of personnel and so on. The smooth daily supply of online fresh agricultural products is conducive to soothing the pessimistic emotions and to encouraging their active obedience to epidemic prevention and control policy. Therefore, it is of great importance to explore the preference characteristics of consumers? online purchase of fresh agricultural products under this critical situation. In this paper, firstly, Pycharm software is used to collect online comment texts of fresh agricultural products on the online platforms with a total of 34,546 pieces of evaluation data. Secondly, the collected data is preformed into the text preprocessing. To be specific, the obtained online comments are processed by Python, including the process of text duplication between sentences, text duplication within sentences and short sentence filtering. After that, processed texts are subjected to Jieba Text Segmentation to form the final word frequency ranking, involving two procedures, part-of-speech tagging and stop-words removal. Lastly, the results of the LDA model indicate the factors that influence consumers? preferences when they purchase fresh agricultural products online. This study could not only identify the typical features of residents? online shopping preference in the context of the spread of COVID-19, but also provide pragmatic suggestions for the local government to appease the residents? negative emotions for the prevention of widespread complaints at the social level."
735;Assessment of social aspects across Europe resulting from the insertion of technologies for nutrient recovery and recycling in agriculture;"Edilene Pereira Andradea,b,* , August Bonmati a , Laureano Jimenez Esteller b , Assumpcio Anton Vallejoa";"The potential beneficial and harmful social impacts generated by the introduction of novel technologies, in general, and those concerning nutrient recovery and the improvement of nutrient efficiency in agriculture, in particular, have received little attention, as shown in the literature. This study investigated the current social impacts of agricultural practices in Belgium, Germany and Spain, and the potential social impacts of novel technologies introduced in agriculture to reduce nutrient losses. Based on 65 indicators used in the PSILCA database, the greatest impacts in the baselines are related to fair salaries, biomass consumption, industrial water depletion and public sector corruption. The potential social impacts of the technologies were assessed using 17 midpoint indicators that have a potential to affect social endpoints. The potential benefits of novel agricultural technologies were the creation of more attractive jobs in agriculture, and a better and healthier environment for local communities, workers and society. However, their harmful effects mainly related to workers and local community health, due to the substances used in the technologies and the potential gases emitted. Given the current lack of Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) studies on novel technologies in agriculture, this study is the first to use the PSILCA database to assess different technologies for nutrient recovery in agriculture in an initial and prospective assessment of their potential social impacts. Further work is required for a site-specific assessment of the technologies when a higher level of social adaptation is achieved."
736;Perceived risks and vulnerabilities of employing digitalization and digital data in agriculture ? Socially robust orientations from a transdisciplinary process;"Jana Zscheischler a,b,* , Reiner Brunsch c , Sebastian Rogga a , Roland W. Scholz d,e,f";"The digitalization of agricultural production and the use of digital data are fundamentally transforming processes, products, and services of the agro-food systems. Digitalization improves efficiency and facilitates sophisticated farm management, thus increasing productivity, efficacy, and profitability. At the same time, it promises many opportunities for a more sustainable and, especially, more ecological and cleaner agricultural production. However, with it comes the potential for a number of unintended side effects and risks that may increase the vulnerability of agricultural production and have, thus far, received scant scientific and societal attention. This article presents the results of a two-year transdisciplinary process that aimed to identify unintended side-effects (short ?unseens?) and perceived risks of digitalization in German agriculture. Results base on a triangulation of knowledge integration from the transdisciplinary group process involving twelve representatives from science and practice and an ethnographic qualitative meta-analysis. The findings have shown that, despite digitalization?s numerous promises for a more ecological and resource efficient agricultural production, a broad range of risks was perceived by some key stakeholders involved. These risks were anticipated to be caused by unintended negative and uncertain side effects on agro-ecological and social systems. Data rights, the restructuring of the value chain with new market concentrations, power structures and dependencies, changing knowledge requirements for farmers (lacking ?digital literacy?), and information asymmetries that may cause potentially negative effects on food security were identified as causal factors. Based on these results, we codeveloped socially robust orientations (SoROs) for coping with resulting risks and vulnerabilities. We argue that these SoROs provide perspectives on how anticipated knowledge can be turned into responsible action within the RRI (responsible research and innovation) framework. Finally, with regard to the preventive and anticipatory paradigm of ?cleaner production?, our transdisciplinary methodology shows a way to adaptively govern the highly complex socio-technological transitions of digitalization in agriculture in the sense of a sustainability-oriented transformation."

Due to nutrient inputs from arable areas, the water quality of rivers and lakes near agricultural lands has deteriorated. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are one of the measures used to improve water quality through natural water treatment processes. We studied phosphorus removal in relation to environmental characteristics in five in-stream free surface flow CWs in Finland, Estonia and Latvia. Wetland/catchment area ratios varied from 0.1% to 5%. Three CWs were covered in dense vegetation. On average, the V? anda CW and Hovi CW TP removal efficiency throughout the study period were highest (32.1 ? 3.6% and 34.9 ? 4.4%, respectively) among all studied CWs. Nummela Gateway CW, Rantamo-Seitteli CW and Mezaciruli CW showed lower TP removal efficiency and on many occasions the outflow concentration exceeded the inflow concentration in Rantamo-Seitteli and Mezaciruli CW. Vegetation cover emerged as the most important factor in the treatment efficiency of in-stream CWs, reducing flow rate, increasing water retention time and decreasing probability of the CW becoming a source of phosphorus during flood events."
738;Declining total carbon stocks in carbonate-containing agricultural soils over a 62-year recultivation chronosequence under humid conditions;"Yi Zhao a,b,c , Riger Reichel c , Michael Herbst c , Yajie Sun c,d , Nicolas Brgemann c , Ramona Morchen ? d , Gerd Welp d , Fanqiao Meng b,* , Roland Bol c,e";"Replanting of mining soils is necessary for utilizing soil resources and increasing cultivated land areas. However, limited information exists on the long-term temporal trends of carbon accrual in agricultural systems containing carbonate-rich soil material. We examined changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total carbon (TC) stocks in an agricultural soil containing carbonate over a 62-year recultivation chronosequence. The most critical differences in the SOC, SIC, and TC stocks were observed in the 0?30 cm soil layer. The results revealed that the SOC stock increased rapidly during the first 10?20 years, but only slowly thereafter. The SIC stock decreased over 62-year from approximately 40 Mg C ha- 1 to 2 Mg C ha- 1 . According to soil d13CTC data, the SIC to TC ratio decreased from 83% (year 0) to 7% (year 62). Overall, the average sequestration rates were 0.30 Mg C ha- 1 y- 1 for SOC and - 0.61 Mg C ha- 1 y- 1 for SIC over the 62 years after recultivation. Total carbon ultimately declined by approximately 19.5 Mg C ha- 1 in recultivated carbonate soils. Topsoil SOC model (Rothamsted Carbon Model) outputs predicted an equilibrium value of 38.6 Mg C ha- 1 after 197 years, which was less than the SIC stock lost in the first 70 years. Therefore, an overall TC increase in these carbonatecontaining agricultural soils will only occur (i) during the initial rapid SOC sequestration accumulation phase (first 20 years of recultivation) and (ii) after the soils are fully decalcified (after ~62 years), but when SOC still slowly increases before SOC stocks reached full equilibrium (after ~197 years). However, compared with starting TC stocks, when we consider periods over a semicentennial and beyond, we will likely lose more TC than we gain in these recultivated agricultural soils if there are no additional TC sequestration measures."
739;Improving the spatiotemporal fusion accuracy of fractional vegetation cover in agricultural regions by combining vegetation growth models;"Guofeng Tao a,b , Kun Jia a,b,* , Xiangqin Wei c , Mu Xia a,b , Bing Wang a,b , Xianhong Xie a,b , Bo Jiang a,b , Yunjun Yao a,b , Xiaotong Zhang a,b";"Spatiotemporal fusion has provided a feasible way to generate fractional vegetation cover (FVC) data with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, when the currently available spatiotemporal fusion methods are applied over agricultural regions, they usually underestimate high FVC values at the peak vegetation growth stage with medium FVC values as base data. This mainly results from inconsistencies in the temporal variations between fine- and coarse-resolution data if substantial temporal changes occur in vegetation. Therefore, a Spatial and Temporal Fusion method combining with Vegetation Growth Models (STF-VGM) was proposed to address this problem in this study, which incorporates vegetation growth models into the fusion process. Unlike other spatiotemporal fusion methods that mainly rely on changes in coarse-resolution data for prediction, STF-VGM fully utilizes available coarse- and fine-resolution time series data, including uncontaminated information in cloud/cloud shadow contaminated images. By establishing vegetation growth models with time series data, a conversion relationship between coarse- and fine-resolution FVC that changes along with the nonlinear vegetation change process can be extracted. STF-VGM makes prediction based on this variable relationship. A typical agricultural region located in the North China Plain was selected as the study area. The validation results indicated that the prediction accuracy for high FVC values was significantly improved using STF-VGM compared to the commonly used Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) and Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) methods (STF-VGM: coefficient of determination (R2 ) = 0.9491, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.0650, average difference (AD) = -0.0092 ESTARFM: R2 = 0.9341, RMSE = 0.1127, AD = -0.0631 FSDAF: R2 = 0.9224, RMSE = 0.1110, AD = -0.0599). The satisfactory performance of STF-VGM was also achieved in predicting FVC values at other vegetation growth stages (early growth stage: R2 = 0.8277, RMSE = 0.0440, AD = 0.0027 rapid growth stage: R2 = 0.9183, RMSE = 0.0844, AD = 0.0500). In addition, STF-VGM also has the potential to improve the spatiotemporal fusion accuracy of other vegetation parameters and vegetation indices, which will be evaluated in the future."
740;SAMZ-Desert: A Satellite-based agricultural management zoning tool for the desert agriculture region of southern California;"Akanksha Garg, Anish Sapkota, Amir Haghverdi *";"A GIS and remote sensing-based decision support tool called SAMZ-Desert was developed for management zones (MZs) delineation of a total of 6852 fields in the Imperial County region of southern California using Landsat-8 NDVI data acquired on 27/4 2018. In addition, a total number of 11 cloud-free images in 2018?2020 were statistically analyzed to determine the extent of within-field NDVI variability and temporal stability of MZs at the regional level. A majority (approx. 37%) of the fields had four zones as an optimum number of zones in the region, which could explain>85% of the within-field NDVI variance. Around 13% (n = 873) of the fields in the region were strongly spatially-clustered in at least half the Landsat-8 cloud-free scenes and can benefit from variable rate technologies. Our results suggest that dynamic zoning over time might be necessary for most of these fields. SAMZ-Desert can be accessed from the Haghverdi Water Management Group website: http://www. ucrwater.com/software-and-tools.html."
741;"Agricultural activities lead to sediment infilling of wetlandscapes in the Canadian Prairies: Assessment of contributions by tillage, water and wind erosion";"Ehsan Zarrinabadi a,* , David A. Lobb a , Sheng Li a,b , Alexander J. Koiter a,c , Pascal Badiou d";"Soil erosion and sediment delivery models have been increasingly employed in studies of catchment sediment dynamics in current years. These models are also used to represent the spatial interaction of soil erosion and sediment transport processes, thereby providing spatially-distributed predictions of soil redistribution rates for agricultural landscapes. It has been widely recognized that individual soil erosion processes and their interactions contribute towards total soil erosion however, quantifying the rates and patterns of soil erosion processes and their interactions within topographically complex landscapes is challenging. Therefore, the objective of this research was to estimate and model the relative contributions of tillage, water and wind erosion towards total soil erosion in the Canadian Prairie provinces of Manitoba and Alberta using 137Cs, a fallout radionuclide tracer, and three well-established models: (i) Tillage Erosion Model (TillEM) (ii) Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, version 2 (RUSLE2) and (iii) Single-event Wind Erosion Evaluation Program (SWEEP). The findings indicate that the patterns of 137Cs-estimated soil erosion were closely matched with the erosion pattern predicted by TillEM and suggests that tillage erosion dominates the pattern of total soil erosion on the knolls of hummocky landscapes. Additionally, soil particle size variation within the wetland catchments reflected the modeled patterns of water and tillage erosion. Furthermore, our findings confirmed that colour coefficients are useful in identifying spatial heterogeneity of soil within wetland catchments and reflect the patterns of soil loss and gains. These results indicate that water and tillage erosion, and also their interactions, are main erosion processes in the Canadian Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), but that soil movement by tillage practices has been the predominant redistribution process."
742;Natural grassland remnants in dynamic agricultural landscapes: identifying drivers of fragmentation;"C. R?s a,*, F. Lezama b, G. Rama b, G. Baldi c, S. Baeza b";"Grasslands have been subject to contraction and fragmentation processes worldwide, mainly due to their transformation into commercial tree plantations and agricultural lands. Identifying the remaining grasslands areas and the drivers of its fragmentation constitute an important step towards their appreciation, conservation and sustainability monitoring. The Eastern Plains of Uruguay constitute a region of recognized national and international conservation importance, but rice cultivation has spread extensively over the last 60 years, resulting in a strong transformation of its natural biomes. Our objectives were to map natural grasslands remnants in this complex landscape characterized by a high presence of different post-agricultural stages of vegetation to quantify grassland fragmentation and its spatial variability in the landscape and to identify the main drivers of the fragmentation process. We intersected a current supervised classification of the Eastern Plains of Uruguay (743,600 ha) with a mask of croplands from the previous ten years to discriminate grasslands remnants. We quantified the landscape fragmentation and described the relative contribution of different biophysical and anthropogenic factors in grasslands spatial configuration. Our results showed that natural grassland currently occupies only 21% of the Eastern Plains surface and it is in an advanced stage of fragmentation, comparable to that of the most historically transformed regions of the Rio de la Plata Grasslands. A few variables that determine the expansion of agriculture (large cadastral parcels size, high road network density and low topographical variation) drive the fragmentation process, relegating grassland to places with unfavorable characteristics for the development of rice cultivation."
743;A resilience-based approach for water resources management over a typical agricultural region in Northwest China under water-energy-food nexus;"Qianxi Shen a,b , Jun Niu a,b,c,* , Qi Liu a,b , Dehai Liao a,b , Taisheng Du a,b,c";"Agriculture in the arid regions must take effective measures to cope with the constant challenges brought by climate warming and possible resource attenuation. As a typical agriculture region in Northwest China, the water resources resilience has been under varying degrees of pressure over the past two decades. To mitigate the stress of water resources, this study explored the optimal arrangement of agronomic and water-saving measures in farmland system under water-energy-food nexus. The finer simulations with reflecting the spatial heterogeneity was realized by employing G-AquaCrop model. Both water resources resilience evaluation model and the waterenergy-food nexus coupling coordination evaluation model were constructed for the farmland system in the arid region. The results show that the combination of plastic film mulching and drip irrigation measures, among nine scenario sets of the different agronomic and water-saving measures, can be largely implemented in the Gaotai, Linze, Ganzhou and Minle Counties in Zhangye, which are mainly distributed in the lower reaches of the Heihe River basin in Northwest China. Alternative diversified management could be adopted elsewhere in the basin. The measures obtained have the merit of addressing the challenges of future climate change, especially for the agricultural regions in water-shortage area."
744;MIL-101(Cr)@Fe3O4 nanocomposites as magnetic solid-phase extraction adsorbent for the determination of multiple mycotoxins in agricultural products by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry;"Dakai Guo a , Qingwen Huang a , Rui Zhao a,b , Wenbo Guo a , Kai Fan a , Zheng Han a , Zhihui Zhao a,**, Dongxia Nie a,";"An efficient and fast magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) method was developed using MIL-101(Cr)@Fe3O4 nanocomposites as adsorbent for purification and enrichment of 9 mycotoxins in agricultural products. The successful synthesis of MIL-101(Cr)@Fe3O4 was confirmed via various characterization methods. Several key parameters affecting the performance of the MSPE procedure were extensively investigated including loading solution, elution solution and dosage of adsorbents. Under the optimal sample pretreatment conditions, the complex matrix effects from different agricultural products could be efficiently eliminated and the calibration curves constructed in neat solvent were directly used for the accurate quantification of these mycotoxins. Coupled with the analysis by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, good linearity (R2 = 0.991), high sensitivity (limit of quantification in the range of 0.08?0.20 ?g kg- 1 ), satisfactory recovery (83.5?108.5%) and acceptable precision (RSD, 1.6?10.4%) were obtained. The applicability of the validated method was further verified in real maize, wheat, watermelon and melon samples."
745;A machine learning approach for identifying and delineating agricultural fields and their multi-temporal dynamics using three decades of Landsat data;"Ting Li * , Kasper Johansen , Matthew F. McCabe *";"High spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery are essential data for land cover discrimination and mapping of vegetation dynamics, offering insights into the number, extent, and condition of agricultural fields. However, an accurate account of the number, location, and variability of fields can be challenging to obtain in a timely manner, particularly at scale or in regions where ground-supporting data are not available, limiting the capacity for food production and water use assessment and planning. To bridge this capacity gap, a convolutional neural network approach was adopted and combined with two clustering techniques: the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and spectral clustering, to provide an account of agricultural fields and their extent across a region lacking ground based information. A random forest classification was also employed to discriminate crop types. Using an annual maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from 2018 Landsat-8 data, the approach was applied to classify the shape and delineate the extent of agricultural fields across an agricultural region in Saudi Arabia that had an area under irrigation exceeding 2,300 km2 . When assessed against manually identified center-pivot fields (CPFs), the method achieved 97.4% producer?s and 98.0% user?s accuracies on an object basis, and 81.4% producer?s and 85.4% user?s accuracies on a pixel basis for identifying non-CPFs (i.e., tree crop plantations and other non-woody crops). The over- and under-segmentation error for CPFs was 1.5% and 1.0%, respectively, with intersection over union errors reported as being 3.5%. The framework showed stability when retrospectively applied to Landsat data from the year 2000, returning 97.5% producer?s and 96.6% user?s accuracies for CPF identification. In order to characterize the temporal dynamics of agricultural development over the past three decades, an analysis of field behavior between 1988 and 2020 was subsequently undertaken. The analysis indicated that the number of CPFs in the study region increased from 45 (covering 20 km2 ) in 1988 to 5,080 CPFs by 2016 (covering 2,368 km2 ), followed by a recent reduction to 3,700 CPFs in 2020 (covering 1,581 km2 ). Through the multi-temporal analysis, individual fields were able to be characterized in terms of their expansion, contraction and activity throughout the study period. Overall, the proposed method was simple to train, efficient in dealing with large datasets, relied on limited in-situ records to a very small degree, and has the potential to be applied to larger national scales, providing an ongoing assessment of important agroinformatic metrics."
746;Targeting sustainable greenhouse agriculture policies in China and Denmark: A comparative study;"Suxia Liu a,f,* , Majken Deichmann a,b,f,h , MariA. Moro b,f , Lars S. Andersen c , Fulin Li d , Tommy Dalgaard e , Ursula S. McKnight b,g";"Greenhouse agriculture has become vitally important in promoting sustainable food supplies globally, especially by encouraging local production and consumption practices. However, it also represents an industry with a high risk for groundwater pollution due to much higher application limits allowed for nitrogen fertilizers compared to conventional agriculture. Although sufficient focus has been placed on characterizing any environmental impacts stemming from agriculture, including greenhouses, the influence of social, economic and political aspects on this process are generally overlooked. This one-sided focus may be partly due to the complexity of environmental systems, i.e. in measuring the state of the system accurately. However, any actions taken by a government, i.e. in the form of policy instruments, will play a key role in ensuring the safety and quality of agricultural products and the surrounding environmental systems. Insufficient knowledge regarding policy and related influential factors may thus slow the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and ultimately inhibit environmental protection. In light of this, a cross-national comparative study was carried out to enable a systematic understanding of Chinese and Danish greenhouse agriculture policy using the agro-environmental DPSIR (Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, Response) indicator framework. We critically examined whether current legislative steps for mitigating anthropogenic sources of N-pollution are suitably aimed at the parameters controlling (driving) specific pressures/impacts on groundwater. The potential for reaction (feedback/responses) within each legislative system, as well as the key gaps in policy responses for monitoring both water and N-fertilizer applied in greenhouses were identified. Notably, most responses are found to target only the pressure component of the framework. This discovery opens the door for the development of additional response mechanisms, which together could result in more sustainable policy measures for greenhouse agriculture that may be more effective, more quickly. Although many countermeasures exist for control of land, water and fertilizer use at the national level in both countries, their deployment depends heavily on effective stakeholder engagement and local-level adoption strategies, indicating a more holistic and multi-objective (less fragmented) policy approach is needed. Importantly, this paper demonstrates an alternative implementation of the DPSIR framework, where comparative study applications may be used to enable mutual learning that may enhance the uptake of disruptive solutions (technological and/or policy advancement), recognizing that incremental change may not be costefficient or sustainable especially for regions with critical water issues."
747;A Monitoring Digital Twin for Services of Controlled Environment Agriculture;Juan Pablo Gonz?alez * David Sanchez-Londo?no * Giacomo Barbieri;"Due to the higher level of automation than traditional agricultural systems, Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) applications generally achieve better yields and quality crops at the expenses of higher energy consumption. Digital Twin (DT) is considered a technology with the potential to bring CEA to new levels of productivity and sustainability. In this context, a monitoring Digital Twin (mDT) has been developed to provide services for the monitoring of the different subsystems of CEA facilities. By integrating open-source software tools, an architecture was built able to: i) gather different types of data collected from a CEA facility ii) store the collected data and calculate relevant features from them iii) locally and remotely display the assessed data. The implemented mDT has the potential to generate a database of CEA data that in future may be utilized by predictive and prescriptive algorithms to suggest actions able to improve the productivity and sustainability of the proces"
748;Analysis of the agricultural innovation system in Indonesia: A case study of the beef sector in Nusa Tenggara Barat;"Erika Valerio a,* , Nurul Hilmiati b , Julian Prior a , Dahlan Dahlanuddin c";"CONTEXT: The demand for beef in Indonesia has increased over the last decade however, national production barely meets half of the domestic demand. This gap creates an opportunity for beef smallholder farmers to improve their livelihoods by increasing their participation in the domestic market. Innovation is central to supporting smallholder farmers to benefit from this increase in beef demand in Indonesia. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to analyse the barriers to the innovation system in the Indonesian beef sector in the province of Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) to identify opportunities to increase smallholder beef productivity. METHODS: In the analysis, we applied the agricultural innovation system (AIS) framework to identify constraints for boosting beef production in the province. We used qualitative data (in-depth interviews and focus group discussions) collected in NTB and data from a literature review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed significant constraints across all AIS functions that ultimately translated to poor innovation in the beef sector in NTB. The results showed that the beef innovation system is constrained by multiple factors, including the lack of farmers professionalisation, lack of agricultural R&D investments, underdeveloped beef value chain, and lack of incentives for PPPs. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings inform policy in NTB and increase smallholder beef productivity. Additionally, the findings point to constraints that are likely common in beef production in many developing countries, and that could be considered when developing policy in other areas in Indonesia."

750;Circularity indicators and their relation with nutrient use efficiency in agriculture and food systems;"Marloes P. van Loon a,* , Wytse J. Vonk a , Renske Hijbeek a , Martin K. van Ittersum a , Hein F.M. ten Berge b";"CONTEXT: Circular resource use in agriculture and food systems could play an important role when aiming for sufficient food output with limited environmental impact and resource depletion. Circularity, however, is not a goal in itself. With respect to nutrient use and emissions, agricultural system sustainability is currently commonly assessed by nutrient output/input ratio (O/I, nutrient use efficiency) or surplus per ha (I?O). OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to assess how these sustainability indicators are related to nutrient cycling. METHODS: Starting from basic circularity concepts, a set of equations (frame) is presented that relates nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling to food product output, or to food use by human consumers. Circularity indicators express how many times a nutrient input cohort completes a full cycle (CyCt), or passes through the system?s top trophic compartment (UseCt). Examples of such compartments are the crop (arable systems), the herd (livestock farms), and the human population (regional food systems). UseCt governs export in useful product. The frame allows to predict equilibrium O/I from system properties, and to attribute parts of O/I to direct (linear) and cycled flow. CyCtR quantifies how many cycles could be completed by nutrients in absence of product export. CyCtR allows to assess the efficacy of returning waste from exported products. Above indicators are compared against Finn cycling index and Figge circularity index, more commonly used in ecological and industrial research respectively. All indicators are calculated for systems of increasing complexity: (i) a UK wheat field, (ii) a Dutch dairy farm, and (iii) the Flanders regional food system. Their responses to changes in system properties are analysed for examples ii and iii. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Nutrient flows in UK arable field and Flanders are almost linear. In UK arable field, O/I equals 0.74 (N) and 0.66 (P), with small contributions from cycled flow (9% for N, 5% for P). In Flanders, cycled flow constitutes only 2% of total N and P flows that reach the human consumer in Flanders. The dairy farm shows largest  ontributions of cycled flow: 35% (N) and 60% (P) of O/I comes from cycled flow, but O/I itself is only 0.28 (N) and 0.72 (P). SIGNIFICANCE: The presented frame allows to assess the impacts of system changes on productivity, nutrient cycling, resource use and nutrient emissions. This is useful for ex-ante assessment of measures that reduce nutrient losses from the system or increase the retrieval of external waste flows."
751;"Multiscale spillovers, connectedness, and portfolio management among precious and industrial metals, energy, agriculture, and livestock futures";"Walid Mensi a,b , Xuan Vinh Vo c , Sang Hoon Kang d,e,";"This study examines the connectedness among 28 commodity futures markets comprising precious metals, industrial metals, energy, agriculture, and livestock. We use the frequency-domain spillover method of Barun? and K?rehl? (2018) and wavelet approach to account for investment horizons. The results show evidence of timevarying spillovers, which is intensified by economic and political events. The total spillover is higher in the short term than in the long term. Livestock market is the least contributor/receiver of risk to/from other markets. A portfolio risk analysis reveals that a combined portfolio composed of WTI crude oil and other commodity assets offers better downside risk reduction. The latter is more important in the short term than in the long term. These results are important for investors and policymakers."

In the present study, we undertook to monitor and evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of an irrigated area with a center pivot in a region of the Brazilian semiarid region, based on physical and water parameters of the energy balance, using remote sensing techniques. The work was developed using three Landsat-8 satellite images, implementing the Surface Energy Balance Algorithms for Land (SEBAL), responsible for extracting geospatial information. In addition, surface meteorological data were used for image corrections and calibrations. The results presented, from thematic maps, monitoring of the spatiotemporal dynamics of irrigated areas, specifying mainly the production of irrigated corn with pivot. Thus, because of the physical-water parameters, photosynthetically active radiation irrigated areas and water deficit were identified, with higher and lower values of the radiation balance, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture, respectively. Therefore, spatiotemporal monitoring of the dynamics of irrigated areas can help in planning and managing the proper management of agricultural systems for the sustainable use of water in the Brazilian semiarid region. The MNDWI proved to be sensitive and efficient to analyze the dynamics of the presence of water in center pivot irrigation and can be an effective part of irrigation management in the region."

Ensuring access to nutritious food is essential to the survival of the world?s population, given this continued growth. Agriculture also plays a critical role in developing countries economies. The difference in supply and demand for food or agriculture has an impact on the overall state of the economy. Plant diseases pose a serious risk to food yield, which could lead to hunger and economic slowdown. The proposed Improved Quantum Whale Optimization with Principle Component Analysis (IQWO-PCA) on using a Machine Learning (ML) model to evaluate a collection of images of tomato disease to take the appropriate preventative measures to deal with this agricultural catastrophe. The dataset used in this study was derived from an easily available plant village dataset. The network is developed after the hyperparameters are optimized in the systematic review. Four trained prototypes are used to develop the transmission learning-based DNN: Alexnet, VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121.Using an approach to optimize composite building blocks, the main features of the data set are retrieved. To better classify tomato diseases, the recovered data are loaded into a deep neuronal network. The proposed model is then evaluated using traditional ML methodologies to determine its superiority in terms of precision measurements and loss rates."
754;The effect of heavy rainfall events on nitrogen patterns in agricultural surface and underground streams and the implications for karst water quality protection;"Zhong-Jun Wang a , Fu-Jun Yue b,* , Yu-Chun Wang c , Cai-Qing Qin d , Hu Ding b , Li-Li Xue a , Si-Liang Li b";"Special hydrological structures coupled with rainfall and agricultural activities have great impacts on water quality in karst areas. High-frequency hydro-chemical, dual nitrate isotopes and a Bayesian mixing model (SIAR) were employed to investigate the effect of heavy rainfall events on nitrogen patterns in surface and underground streams and explore the implications for nitrogen pollution prevention in a typical karst agricultural catchment in Southwest China. The results showed that [NO3 - -N] was relatively high in both surface and underground streams and the average value in surface stream was two times higher than in underground stream. The lowest [NO3 - -N] of underground stream was found in the falling limb of the hydrograph. According to source apportionment by SIAR, chemical fertilizer was the dominant nitrate source in the study area, which contributed 52?81% and 29?78% of nitrate in surface stream and underground stream, respectively. The highest dissolved inorganic nitrogen flux and [NO3 - -N] in surface stream was 5.7 times and 2.4 times higher, respectively, than in underground stream over the same period, which suggested that surface runoff rather than underground stream was the main route of rapid nitrogen loss in the karst catchment during heavy rainfall events. Reasonably planning the fertilization time and optimizing nitrogen fertilizer use should be considered to decrease nitrogen loss from farmland. Rational use of a widespread karst underground conduit system to reduce water nitrogen content may also be a potential method for achieving nitrogen removal."
755;Spatio-temporal dynamic evaluation of agricultural drought based on a three-dimensional identification method in Northwest China;"Kai Feng a,b , Ziqi Yan b,* , Yanbin Li a , Fei Wang a , Zezhong Zhang a , Xiaoling Su c , Haijiang Wu c , Gengxi Zhang d , Yingying Wang a";"Drought evolution is a complex dynamic process, showing continuous characteristics in space-time. Currently, the researches on drought dynamics from multiple dimensions are limited and should be improved further. Therefore, a three-dimensional identification method was adopted to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of classified drought events (namely two-month drought events, within-year drought events, and cross-year drought events) in northwest China during1961?2018. Furthermore, more spatial variables of drought event, such as start and end location, drought orientation and rotation, were extracted to describe the dynamic migration trajectories of drought events. Significantly, drought rotation helped to reveal the forcing mechanisms (such as the influence of climate and land surface) behind their spatial development. The results showed that a total of 169 drought events were identified over 1961?2018, and drought variables (duration, area, severity, and migration distance) represented fluctuating decreasing trend with the rate of - 0.135/10a, - 0.006/10a, - 0.16/10a, and - 5.67/ 10a. The dynamic migration process of individual drought event was objectively and effectively depicted from a three-dimensional perspective, which was consistent with the historical drought records in study area. Regarding the classified events, drought magnitude was more severe in 1961?1980 than that in 1981?2018, and three primary migration patterns (east-to-east, west-to-west, and south-to-south) were identified in northwest China. Within-year drought events mostly started in the first three quarters and finished in the second half year, whilst the situation was reversed for the cross-year drought events. Spatially, Alxa League of Inner Mongolia and northwest Qinghai Province were two main drought centers. Additionally, drought events characterized by clockwise rotation migration were mostly distributed in the plateau and southeast climate zones, and that was anticlockwise rotation in the westerly climate zone. Noticeably, the east-to-east pathways were mainly located in the east part of the study area, while the west-to-west and south-to-south trajectories were dominated in the west part."
756;Prospects of an agricultural drought early warning system in South Africa;"Teboho E. Masupha a,b,* , Mokhele E. Moeletsi a,c , Mitsuru Tsubo d";"In recent decades, ample scientific and institutional efforts have been devoted to developing agricultural drought early warning systems as part of disaster risk reduction programs. This review considered the status quo in South Africa and addressed various factors on the prospects of applying key lessons for a probable system. Additionally, the review explored external factors, corresponding to opportunities, and threats, by learning from established web-based agricultural drought early warning systems around the world. Various characteristics were found among these systems and the most common include inter alia, the capability to forecast impending drought, comprise a processing functionality and provides the level of drought impact on agriculture. The least common, yet vital included the integration of field observations, an interactive map and contingency plans. Factors such as the possibility of providing false information due to lack of calibration, slow adoption rate and lack of secure human and financial commitment were viewed as potential hurdles, which should be perceived as modes of opportunity. Accordingly, the study recommended the use of innovative technologies to translate hazard into impact, provide value-added contingency plans and improve stakeholder communication for further developments."

This study applies two methods to rapidly monitor Zn concentration in agricultural soil. Firstly, employing Vis-NIR and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) (Context 1) and secondly, applying Vis-NIR, soil chemical properties (SCP), and MLAs (Context 2). For the Vis-NIR information, single and combined pretreatment methods were applied. The following MLAs were used: conditional inference forest (CIF), partial least squares regression (PLSR), M5 tree model (M5), extreme gradient boosting (EGB), and support vector machine regression (SVMR) respectively. For context 1, the results indicated that M5-MSC (M5 tree model-multiplicative scatter correction) with coefficient of determination (R2 ) = 0.72, root mean square error (RMSE) = 21.08 (mg/ kg), median absolute error (MdAE) = 13.69 and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) = 1.63 was promising. Regarding context 2, CIF with spectral pretreatment and soil properties [CIF-DWTLOGMSC + SCP (conditional inference forest-discrete wavelet transformation-logarithmic transformation-multiplicative scatter correction-soil chemical properties)] yielded the best performance of R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 14.52 (mg/kg), MdAE = 6.25 and RPIQ = 1.78. Altogether, for contexts 1 and 2, the CIF-DWTLOGMSC + SCP approach (context 2) was the best Zn model outcome for the agricultural soil. The uncertainty map revealed a low to high error distribution in context 1, and a low to moderate distribution in context 2 for all models except CIF, which had some patches with high uncertainty. We conclude that a multiple optimization approach for modeling Zn levels in agricultural soils is invaluable and may provide fast and reliable information needed for area-specific decision-making."
758;"Modelling agricultural transformation: A remote sensing-based analysis of wetlands changes in Rajshahi, Bangladesh";"Faruk Hossain, Md Masud Parves Rana* , Md Moniruzzaman";"Agricultural transformation is one of the important factors of rural planning and sustainable land management. There are natural and man-made reasons of this transformation, which brings both positive and negative impacts on the physical environment, food security, and human livelihoods. This study aims to explore a case of land use conversion from traditional agricultural land to the man-made wetland for fisheries in Rajshahi, Bangladesh. The conversion might be a result of purposeful land use and land cover changes to continue agricultural production for the market demands. A hybrid model of logistic regression and water index has been used to investigate the dynamics of LULC (Land Use Land Cover) changes. Moderate-resolution multi-temporal Landsat imageries of 2000, 2010, and 2020 have been used for visual interpretation and quantitative analysis. During the study period of 20 years, wetlands for entrepreneurial pond culture were remarkably increased, while agricultural land and vegetation experienced a decreasing trend. It is predicted that wetlands are going to be further increased by diminishing agricultural land and vegetation until 2030. Despite the fact of suitable data unavailability, this study also shows that the remote sensing approach provides a powerful tool for analysing and monitoring spatiotemporal agricultural transformation. Moreover, the empirical findings of land use modelling might be useful for agricultural planning and decision-making in rural Bangladesh."

Osborne b";"We synthesise the results of a large programme of plant ecological research to investigate the selective pressures driving crop domestication and the origins of agriculture in western Asia. We explore this primarily through a series of experiments, comparing the ecological characteristics of: (1) domesticated cereal and pulse species with their wild progenitors and (2) the wild progenitor species with other west Asian grasses and legumes that did not become domesticated during the emergence of agriculture. In particular, we consider the balance between deliberate human selection and unintended consequences of human actions in driving the domestication process. Taken together, our results provide the first empirical evidence to suggest that ecological processes, and unintended selection due to competition between growing plants within anthropogenic environments, may have played a more significant part in the emergence of agriculture than previously supposed. Such human-plant coevolutionary mechanisms would render unnecessary the search for ?push? or ?pull? factors, dependent on deliberate human invention to solve a problem or to satisfy a need, as prime movers to explain why huntergatherers switched to an agricultural way of life."
760;Construction process and development trend of ecological agriculture in China;"Song Chengjun, Sun Renhua, Shi Zuliang, Xue Yinghao, Wang Jiuchen, Xu Zhiyu * , Gao Shangbin";"China?s ecological agriculture has played a pioneering role in sustainable development, which has attracted extensive attention and high praise from the international community. This paper systematically analyzed the development process of China?s eco-agriculture, by combining with the practice of ecological agriculture construction in China for many years and the construction process of modern ecological agriculture base of the Ministry of Agriculture, and comprehensive literature research. The results showed that: 1) The development of China?s eco-agriculture has gone through two periods: traditional ecological agriculture and modern ecological agriculture. Traditional ecological agriculture provides rich production experience. China?s modern agricultural ecology has experienced four development stages: initial exploration (1981?1992), expansion and consolidation (1993?2004), steady advancement (2005?2011) and innovation and promotion (2012?present). Each stage has distinctive features and landmark achievements, which rammed the foundation for the green and sustainable development of agriculture and rural areas in China 2) China?s modern ecological agriculture has been incorporated into the act of government in 1993, and has basically formed a five-level demonstration and driving system of ecological agriculture including 2 pilot provinces for eco-agriculture, 10 demonstration cities for circular agriculture, 100 demonstration counties for eco-agriculture, 12 demonstration bases for eco-agriculture, and 1100 beautiful villages, which cover province, municipality, county, base and village. The advancing mechanism of modern ecological agriculture of ?small circulation in the main body, circulation in the park and large circulation in the county?, has effectively promoted the development of ecological agriculture nationwide 3) China?s eco-agriculture has three distinct characteristics: comprehensiveness, sustainability and diversity. Its basic contents mainly include: agricultural ecology methodology and theoretical basis, optimization design of agricultural ecosystem, assembly and integrated application of eco-agricultural technology 4) Under the trend of agricultural green development, China?s eco-agriculture construction is innovating and improving system and mechanism, and ensuring the development towards high efficiency, industrialization, standardization, practicality and multi-function, thus gradually establishing a resource-saving, environment-friendly and ecological conservation-oriented modern ecological agricultural system with Chinese characteristics, constituting the ecological agriculture development pattern integrating rural production development, prosperous life and good ecology, and helping China?s rural ecological revitalization."

The review also discusses detailed economic evaluation methods and market participation approaches for transitioning solar dryers from the workshop to the market. This study aims to serve as a model for future solar drying reviews. In addition to broad perspective reviews, most reviews focused on using thermal storage, hybrid technologies, solar greenhouses, 4E evaluations, software applications and crop quality. From most of the reviews, solar dryers with thermal storage are now a viable substitute for fossil energy source dryers and can provide the continuous temperature range of 40?60 ?C required to dry food crops. When phase change material is deployed, the transition temperature should be at 5 ?C above the desired drying temperature. However, all reviews included sections on types, classification, mode of airflow through the collector, and use of thermal storage in solar drying. Hence, the authors review nearly the same research material, but review gaps remain. Thus that aspect was covered by examining the economic and exergoeconomic analysis methods used in solar dryer evaluations. Again agribusiness inter-phasing between researchers and users, which will spore market participation of solar dryer fabricators lacking in the literature were presented. Therefore, for a more market-oriented development of solar thermal technologies, solar dryer producers must engage in market-oriented production. The nature of markets located at different places calls for better strategies to improve market orientation and access to solar dryers and fabricators."
762;Numerical modeling of nutrient transport to assess the agricultural impact on the trophic state of reservoirs;"Franklin Torres-Bejarano a, * , Jes? Garc?-Gallego b , Javier Salcedo-Salgado b";"A trophic state increase relates to surface water bodies nutrient enrichment, due to the chemical products used such as fertilizers in agriculture and residues from cattle raising activities. This research consists of nutrient transport numerical modeling to analyze the Betancreservoir trophic state in Colombia Water samples were collected to analyze total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonia, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, BOD, COD, suspended solids, and water transparency. The water quality model MOHID Studio was implemented and after its calibration, scenarios of increase and decrease of nutrients and inflows to the reservoir through its main tributaries were simulated to reproduce the agricultural activity changes in the basin and the effects that would have on the reservoirs trophic state dynamics Therefore, the Carlson Trophic Status Index was calculated for each case. The results show that variations in total nitrogen concentration and increased inflows present short-term consequences on the reservoirs trophic state. Increasing the incoming total nitrogen concentrations by 100% causes the reservoir to change from a light eutrophic to a hypereutrophic state. The results of this research provide a starting tool to water resources integrated management in reservoirs"
763;Melatonin as plant growth regulator in sustainable agriculture;"Pooja Sharma a , Nitika Thakur b,* , Neharika Ann Mann b , Aisha Umar c";"Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a biological indolamine. It is biologically synthesized in plants and can be used to promote sustainable agriculture. This molecule has multiple effects and a wide range of actions that are beneficial to plants. It plays an important role in plants as a modulatory agent (a bio-stimulator and plant growth regulator) that improves the plants tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stress (drought, waterlogging, severe temperatures, salt, alkalinity, chemical contaminants in soils (such as heavy metals, pesticides, and others), UV radiation). It acts as a stress-relieving hormone (regulates anti stress reactions) and as a biostimulator of plant growth. Melatonin maintains redox equilibrium (removing ROS and RNS), is a stress reduction agent, promotes root growth and development, encourages plant development, influences flowering and fruit ripening, prevents leaf senescence, improves gene expression and activity of enzymes, improves photosynthesis, shields plants from pathogen attack (regulates plant innate immunity, initiate defense responses) and influences other biochemical and physiological processes. This review explores these special functions of melatonin and how it impacts different plant systems specifically. Research is already ongoing in this field and through this compilation we can conclude that melatonin, a bio stimulator, is a crucial molecule that can be essential in increasing crop yields and nutraceutical values useful for addressing global food security issues."
764;The ecosystem approach to agricultural value chain finance: A framework for rural credit;"Roberto Villalba ? , Terese E. Venus, Johannes Sauer";"In developing countries, smallholder farmers often lack long-lasting sources of credit. While traditional banking, microfinance, and cooperatives have addressed some financing gaps, Agricultural Value Chain Finance (AVCF) has attracted attention as it allows value chain actors to leverage social capital and satisfy their funding needs. To identify the driving factors for the development of AVCF, we analyze the role of non-farmer actors including banks, development organizations, agribusinesses, and academia using indepth expert interviews. Following a Grounded Theory approach, we propose the Ecosystem Approach as a framework for establishing long-lasting AVCF schemes in developing countries based on three critical solutions: building financial platforms for value chain transaction records, implementing bundled services for the value chain, and evolving from a value chain to a value web approach. Our findings introduce six propositions that shed light on key factors for the development and longevity of financing schemes: i) the AVCF Ecosystem, ii) how AVCF schemes emerge, iii) social capital and value chain interactions, iv) culture and value chain characteristics, v) market risk, vi) transaction costs reduction. We find that AVCF can use social and trade capital to reduce transaction costs and mitigate risks related to quality, prices, and markets. In AVCF ecosystems, there are financial products for interlinked agricultural value chains with a balanced focus on all chain actors, no lock-in relationships between the lenders and the borrowers, and multiple benefits for participants. As the evolution towards an Ecosystem Approach offers a promising outlook for agricultural credit, future research should explore how policymakers and development agencies can support these schemes and how they can be used to increase financial access and equity in rural communities."
765;"An overview of agriculture 4.0 development: Systematic review of descriptions, technologies, barriers, advantages, and disadvantages";"Franco da Silveira * , Fernando Henrique Lermen , Fernando Gon?lves Amaral";"Agriculture 4.0 upgrades traditional production methods and world agriculture strategies to an optimized value chain using a range of emerging technologies that enhance disruptive solutions at all stages of the agricultural production chain. Due to the complexity of the changing farm ecosystem, the new technological revolution?s benefits will not be shared evenly. It is necessary to understand the problems and challenges that need to be addressed so that all countries fully benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0. This study aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by identifying descriptions, technologies, barriers, advantages, and disadvantages. Three independent researchers carried out a Systematic Literature Review based on the Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria pre-established in the Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, 50 articles were selected for analysis. As a result, it was possible to identify the descriptions of agriculture 4.0, propose a definition, and present a compilation of approaches related to the term. Technologies of agriculture 4.0, responsible for revolutionizing and impacting how commodities are produced, processed, traded, and consumed, were also surveyed. Moreover, the barriers that hinder the development of agriculture 4.0 and that limit its progress are listed. The barriers were classified into five dimensions: technological, economic, political, social, and environmental. These are issues that need to be resolved in different areas to achieve a larger scale in countries looking to implement agriculture 4.0. Finally, this study?s findings support actors in the agricultural production chain and pave the way for the successful development of agriculture 4.0. Besides, research helps broaden the inclusive debate that can shape the introduction of agriculture 4.0."
766;"Advances of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications in agricultural building modelling: Research, applications and challenges";"Pierre-Emmanuel Bournet a,b,* , Fernando Rojano c";"Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach is a versatile technique being applied to multiple areas of knowledge. CFD approach has contributed to comprehensively understand the complexity of biological systems and it has gained relevance since the end of the twentieth century. CFD became the key approach to replicate spatiotemporal phenomena combining fundamentals of physics, chemistry and biology. A considerable development derived from numerous CFD studies has been accomplished in a large range of applications in agriculture such as biological systems, and in agricultural buildings in particular. This paper provides an examination of recent progress (last 2 decades) in CFD studies, mainly applied to greenhouses and livestock buildings with the aim to depict current status and trends and potential research directions. Current status comprises CFD applied to regional and local climate, housing design and operation and animal or plant interaction with its surroundings. Integrating different scales from animal or plant physiologic responses to an agricultural building and to a region, CFD capabilities have made it possible to considerably improve the realism of simulations. Applications also cover a focus on specific equipments with the aim to assess benefits on energy and water fluxes. Additionally, the issues of validation and reliability of CFD simulations are addressed as well as the perspective of coupling CFD to operational devices or decision-making systems, based on ICT, IoT, or Artificial Intelligence."
767;Immigration and integration in rural areas and the agricultural sector: An EU perspective;"Sona Kalantaryan a,* , Marco Scipioni a , Fabrizio Natale a , Alfredo Alessandrini a";"Immigrants in rural areas and immigrant employment in the agricultural sector have been studied from a variety of perspectives. However, we currently lack a bird?s-eye view of these two phenomena covering all EU member states through time. This paper tackles that gap, first by describing the main features of immigrant settlement and economic integration in rural areas in the EU. Second, it offers an EU-wide overview of immigrants? integration in the agricultural sector. Then, it investigates empirically the degree to which the different characteristics of agricultural production in two member states ? Italy and Spain ? are associated with a migrant presence in the area. The study finds that, in the context of a shrinking agricultural labour force, the share of migrant workers in that sector in several regions is increasing over time. Migrants living in rural areas are more likely to be unemployed and face economic hardship than locals. Migrants employed in agriculture are, also, more likely to work in elementary occupations and temporary jobs. Finally, the case studies on Italy and Spain demonstrate that the relative size of the migrant population is related to the typology of agricultural land use and to the labour intensity and seasonality of cultivation."
768;Biogenic nanoparticles and generation of abiotic stress-resilient plants: A new approach for sustainable agriculture;"Swarnavo Chakraborty 1 , Ankur Singh 1 , Aryadeep Roychoudhury";"Agricultural crop production is getting a significant setback due to global warming and climate change in the modern era. These two factors have significantly induced the severity of abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, extreme temperature and heavy metal toxicity. Upon being exposed to harsh environmental conditions, cytotoxic metabolites such as reactive oxygen species are generated which in turn disturb the homeostatic balance of cells along with inciting membrane damage. In order to overcome the negative effects of abiotic stresses, plant and agrarian scientific reports have shown significant progresses in promoting the efficient and eco-friendly approaches for the synthesis of plant- and microorganism-based synthesis of nanoparticles. Owing to their nanoscale size, nanoparticles possess a large surface/volume ratio that significantly alters their property and characteristic as compared to that of their normal counterparts. Nanoparticles can be physically, chemically and biologically synthesised. While physical and chemical methods have been successfully applied for the generation of nanoparticles of high purity and desired size, these processes are costly and require toxic chemicals. Thus, in the modern era, several investigators have focused their interest on biological methods of nanoparticle synthesis, since such methods are fast, cost effective and eco-friendly. In this review, we attempt to deliver information about plant- and microorganism-mediated synthesis of nanoparticles, based on recent scientific works. We also demonstrate the significance of these nanoparticles in the mitigation of negative impact of abiotic stresses on crop plants which might come handy in near future to the agricultural community."
769;A comprehensive spatially-explicit analysis of agricultural landscape multifunctionality using a New Zealand hill country farm case study;"Duy X. Tran a,* , Diane Pearson a , Alan Palmer a , David Gray a , John Lowry b , Estelle J. Dominati c";"CONTEXT: Multifunctionality can refer to the capacity of a landscape to provide a wide range of ecosystem services (ES). Maintaining or restoring multifunctionality in agricultural landscapes is considered an efficient solution to achieve sustainable agricultural production because multiple ES provided by a landscape can support both environmental protection and socio-economic benefits. Quantifying the provision of ES provides fundamental information to measure landscape multifunctionality and inform sustainable land management strategies. Although a large number of studies have been carried out to measure landscape multifunctionality and associated ES, comprehensive spatially explicit assessments at the farm scale are limited. OBJECTIVE: This research applies a wide range of spatial models, tools, and methods to spatially quantify the provision of multiple ES as well as the pattern of landscape multifunctionality in farmed landscapes. METHODS: To quantify the provision of multiple ES provided by the landscape, the bio-physical models provided by InVEST (e.g., Nutrient Delivery Ratio and Sediment Delivery Ratio models) and land use land cover-based assessments using spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS were employed. The Analytic Hierarchy Process was applied to calculate the landscape multifunctionality index which is an integration of multiple ES supply. Hot spot analysis using Getis Ord Gi* statistics was utilised to examine the spatial distribution of multiple ecosystem services. A hill country farm in New Zealand is chosen as a case study because it is a good example of a diverse landscape that is facing significant environmental issues due to intensive agricultural production. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that the provision of ES and the pattern of landscape multifunctionality is highly variable across the farm. Both positive and negative relationships among ES are found and the interactions between them are mainly reflected in three ES bundles: the agricultural land, the indigenous forest and wetlands, and the mixed land uses. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that the quality of landscape is significantly dependent on the landscape management goals and preferences of the farmer so involving them into the process of ES and landscape multifunctionality assessment at a farm scale is essential step to obtain more comprehensive results. SIGNIFICANCE: Results from this study enable important questions to be answered regarding the spatial variation of ES provision and how land use and land management goals relate to the value and quality of landscape multifunctionality. This can provide valuable information to design future multifunctional landscapes and inform decision making in relation to sustainable land use management."
770;Coffee farmer preferences for sustainable agricultural practices: Findings from discrete choice experiments in Vietnam;"Huong-Giang Pham a,* , Swee-Hoon Chuah b , Simon Feeny c";"Despite the proven benefits of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs), adoption rates among farmers are still low, especially in developing countries. This paper seeks to assist policymakers devise approaches to encourage adoption by identifying the attributes of SAPs that can motivate Vietnamese coffee farmers to adopt them in production. Vietnam is the world?s second largest coffee producer and the sector supports the livelihoods of over half a million people in the country. We conduct two different types of discrete choice experiments with over 300 Vietnamese coffee farmers to identify their SAP preferences. We analyse the data using cluster analysis and generalised multinomial logit models. The results are consistent across our different approaches. They show that these farmers have the strongest preferences for SAPs that can provide higher profits, lower risks (of output loss) and higher environmental benefits. These attributes received mean part-worth utilities of 0.251, 0.250 and 0.239 respectively. Attributes capturing the increase in daily operating efforts and time required to set up such practices are less important considerations. Further, the farmers are willing to pay on average between 26 and 32 million VND per hectare per year for a one level reduction in the risk of output loss and earn 15 million VND per hectare per year less in profits to achieve a one level increase in environmental benefits."
771;Misuses of the terms Day of the Year and Julian Day in agricultural and environmental sciences;"Javier Almorox a,* , Pau Martb";"The purpose of this short communication is to establish a discussion about the correct use of the terms Julian Day and Day of the Year. The Day of the Year is used for environmental modelling and calculating daily solar radiation and evapotranspiration. The concept of Julian Day is misused in the field of agricultural and environmental sciences. Specifically, the use of the term Julian Day might have been misleading or incorrect for the last ten years in the journal Agricultural Water Management. In this brief communication we intend to clarify the concept of Julian Day, and expose the most commonly used equations, so that the concept might be used with more rigor and precision in the future."
772;Solar-powered irrigation system as a nature-based solution for sustaining agricultural water management in the Upper Indus Basin;"Arshad Ashraf * , Khalid Jamil";"Rapid deglaciation in form of lowering of glacial surface under growing warm temperatures form a major cause of disruption in meltwater flows to cryosphere-fed irrigation network which usually affects the agriculture productivity and livelihoods in the Upper Indus Basin (UIB). In such hotspots of cryosphere change and other vulnerable areas, solar powered irrigation system (SPIS) can be adopted as a nature-based solution to uplift water from the nearby glacio-fluvial streams for irrigation and domestic use. In the present study, solar energy harnessing potential was investigated in the UIB region of Pakistan based on climate and topographic suitability to adopt solar powered irrigation system (SPIS) in the region. Overall mean temperature and elevation were found suitable for harnessing solar energy in major parts of the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) ranges of the UIB. The slope index indicated high suitability for harnessing solar energy in about 92.5% area, while aspect exhibited high suitability in about 13.3% area and medium in 25.3% area of the HKH region. The slope-aspect (SLA) suitability was found good in about 13.5% area of the Hindu Kush, 12% of the Karakoram and 10.9% area of the Himalaya range, whereas it was observed medium in about 26.7% area of the Hindu Kush, 21.8% of the Karakoram and 22.2% area of the Himalaya range. Overall the SLA suitability was found good in about 12.1% area and medium in about 23.5% area of the three HKH ranges. However, maximum benefits of the SPIS approach can be acquired through linking it with integrated water resource management approach for sustainable agricultural water management in the region."
773;Effect of agricultural subsidies on the use of chemical fertilizer;"Lili Guo, Houjian Li * , Xuxin Cao, Andi Cao, Minjun Huang";"Agricultural subsidies lead to changes in the use of chemical fertilizer by farmers. Using data from a household survey conducted annually by the Rural Economy Research Center of the Ministry of Agriculture of China from 2014 to 2018, Control Function (CF) approach and Heteroskedasticity-based identification strategy were employed to analyze the impact of agricultural subsidies on chemical fertilizer use by rice farmers. After addressing the problem of endogeneity, we found that agricultural subsidies have a significantly negative impact on the use of chemical fertilizer. Precisely, every 100% increase in agricultural subsidies would result in an average decrease of 3.4% in chemical fertilizer use. In addition, results of heterogeneity analysis showed that agricultural subsidies had a stronger negative impact on fertilizer use as rice-planting experience increases. But the ability of rice-planting management and off-farm labor within household could reduce this negative impact. We also found that the effect of arable land productivity conservation subsidies policy was short-lived. Furthermore, based on the frame of structural equation model (SEM), the results of mediation analysis showed that agricultural machine and rice-planting area had partial mediation of 5.3% and 41%, respectively. It implied that agricultural subsidies reduced fertilizer use by promoting the adoption of agricultural techniques and expanding the planting area. In brief, agricultural subsidies had both technical effect and scale effect. But the mediating effect of household income was not significant. This study is intended to assist the concerned authority and agriculture sector to understand the positive role of agricultural subsidies in sustainable production, and provides some feasible policy proposals."

Crops are characterized by significant change during the growing season, and this information can be used to improve classification accuracy. However, capturing variation in vegetation cover requires a reliable source of valid data. Sentinel-1 radar images are a good candidate, as they supply information about Earth?s surface every six days, independent of weather and light conditions. In this paper, we present a method for crop classification based on radar polarimetry. We propose a set of multi-temporal indices derived from time series Sentinel-1 images that aim to characterize crop phenology. A big data, object-oriented classification technique is developed and tested on 16 crop types for the whole of Poland. Our analysis found that overall accuracy varied (regionally) from 86.36 to 89.13% in 2019, and from 85.95 to 89.81% in 2020. F1 scores for individual crops varied from 0.73 to 0.99, and the use of our multitemporal phenological indices increased F1 scores by about 0.14 compared to calculations using only basic parameters. Results obtained for the whole country demonstrate the efficacy of the method and its resistance to environmental conditions."
775;"Machine learning can identify the sources of heavy metals in agricultural soil: A case study in northern Guangdong Province, China";"Taoran Shi a , Jingru Zhang b , Wenjie Shen c,d,* , Jun Wang b , Xingyuan Li e";"Source tracing of heavy metals in agricultural soils is of critical importance for effective pollution control and targeting policies. It is a great challenge to identify and apportion the complex sources of soil heavy metal pollution. In this study, a traditional analysis method, positive matrix fraction (PMF), and three machine learning methodologies, including self-organizing map (SOM), conditional inference tree (CIT) and random forest (RF), were used to identify and apportion the sources of heavy metals in agricultural soils from Lianzhou, Guangdong Province, China. Based on PMF, the contribution of the total loadings of heavy metals in soil were 19.3% for atmospheric deposition, 65.5% for anthropogenic and geogenic sources, and 15.2% for soil parent materials. Based on SOM model, As, Cd, Hg, Pb and Zn were attributed to mining and geogenic sources Cr, Cu and Ni were derived from geogenic sources. Based on CIT results, the influence of altitude on soil Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni and Zn, as well as soil pH on Cd indicated their primary origin from natural processes. Whereas As and Pb were related to agricultural practices and traffic emissions, respectively. RF model further quantified the importance of variables and identified potential control factors (altitude, soil pH, soil organic carbon) in heavy metal accumulation in soil. This study provides an integrated approach for heavy metals source apportionment with a clear potential for future application in other similar regions, as well as to provide the theoretical basis for undertaking management and assessment of soil heavy metal pollution."
776;Effectiveness of best management practices for non-point source agricultural water pollution control with changing climate ? Lithuania?s case;"Svajunas Plunge a,b,* , Mindaugas Gudas c , Arvydas Povilaitis a";"This study aimed at the evaluation of the change in the effectiveness of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for agricultural pollution control in terms of reduction of nutrient loads to surface water bodies in Lithuania in the context of climate change (CC). The SWAT model was used by applying two CC representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), three time horizons (historical ? 2000?2019, mid-century ? 2040?2059, and end-century ? 2080?2099), and five BMPs (arable land conversion to grasslands, reduced fertilization, no-till farming, catch-crops, and stubble fields throughout winter). The most effective (with the greatest nutrient reduction) BMPs include grasslands, stubble fields, and winter cover crops. No-plough farming and reduced fertilization BMPs appear to be the least effective ones. CC would increase the potential of reduced fertilization and conversion to grasslands BMPs up to 179% and 17%, respectively for total nitrogen (TN) reduction. Regarding total phosphorus (TP), the reduction potential would increase 226% for fertilization reduction, and remain approximate for grasslands (at median - 4%). Due to winter reduction of loads, no-plough stubble fields, and winter cover crops would decrease by as much as - 50%, - 12% and - 26%, respectively for TN, and - 30%, - 11%, and - 17%, respectively for TP, compared to the historical period. The greatest change would be recorded for the most extreme CC scenario (RCP8.5) and the longest time horizon (end-century). The effectiveness of BMPs (except for no-plough) for TN load reduction would increase more, and on average would become greater in agriculture dominated areas (of central-northern Lithuania) than elsewhere, although the maximum reduction values would occur in western (and in some cases eastern) Lithuania (except for reduced fertilization). This suggests the importance of the application of the measures in both areas. BMPs (except for grasslands) are expected to have relatively little effect on the overall crop yield."

DEMETER (Building an Interoperable, Data-Driven, Innovative and Sustainable European Agri-Food Sector) addresses these challenges by providing an overarching solution that integrates various heterogeneous hardware and software resources (e.g., devices, networks, platforms) and enables the seamless sharing of data and knowledge throughout the agri-food chain. This paper introduces the main concepts of DEMETER and its reference architecture to address the data sharing and interoperability needs of farmers, which is validated via two rounds of 20 large-scale pilots along the DEMETER lifecycle. This paper elaborates on the two pilots carried out in region of Murcia in Spain, which target the arable crops sector and demonstrate the benefits of the deployed DEMETER reference architecture."
778;Emergent urban agricultural practices and attitudes in the residential area in China;"Yuan Wei a, *, Paul Jones b";"This paper explores the emergence of urban agriculture and its changing nature and role in the urbanization process in China. With an increase in urban agricultural pursuits in both planned and unplanned residential areas, the focus of the paper is primarily on better understanding the nature of emerging ?informal? practices in built and unbuilt spaces. By using a planned residential area in Kunming, Yunnan Province as a case study, this paper identifies the physical and spatial expressions of urban agriculture practices as well as the motivations and attitudes of stakeholders. The results show that over half of the participants had experience in undertaking urban agricultural practices, with the predominant reason being to fulfill personal interests, including meeting household needs. When undertaking urban agricultural practices, local residents demonstrate their divergent abilities and skills in negotiating, adapting, and managing both private and increasingly incursions into the public domain. Analysis of the empirical results indicates that urban agricultural pursuits are a viable practice which supports the livelihoods and wellbeing of the residents by using innovative, creative and emergent forms in both private and public spaces."
779;"Strategic foresight for agriculture: Past ghosts, present challenges, and future opportunities";"Steven D. Prager a,* , Keith Wiebe b";"Strategic foresight is systematic means to explore plausible futures. In the agricultural context, strategic foresight allows decision-makers to explore how alternative investments in agriculture research may function given anticipated futures associated with a variety of drivers ranging from climate change to increasing wealth to a changing policy environment. This paper presents an overview and context for six recently published articles in Global Food Security that comprise a virtual special issue on agricultural futures. Each of the papers takes a distinct perspective and addresses key issues from how past trends drive future outcomes to specific commodity systems to issues around employment and rural transformation. While each of the included papers stands on its own merits, the collection presents a unique opportunity to unpack the role of investment in agriculture research from a variety of perspectives. Collectively, the special issue offers insights to support current and future investment planning to better target desired outcomes associated with long-term agricultural research."
780;Assessing GHG cycling in agricultural and riparian soils using a uniform reactive transport modeling approach;"Mengqi Jia a,* , Oliver Blume b , Richard T. Amos b , Danyang Su a , David R. Lapen c , K. Ulrich Mayer a";"Agricultural drainage ditches are necessary for regulating moisture contents in fields for crop production, and moreover, they can provide and regulate important ecosystem services. Drainage ditches and their associated riparian zones can be significant sources of enhanced N2O, CH4 and CO2 emissions, since they receive nutrient laden runoff and drainage from adjacent fields, while providing moisture conditions suitable for the production of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In this study, a uniform reactive transport model with up-scaled rate parameters was used to assess the dynamics of GHG cycling and biogeochemical processes in a crop field and riparian soils adjacent to a drainage ditch (i.e., located on the shoulder and midslope of the ditch) in eastern Ontario, Canada. Simulations adequately reproduced observed spatial variations in pore gas GHG concentrations in the cropped field and the monitoring locations near the drainage ditch. Spatial variations can be attributed to differences in environmental factors (i.e., soil moisture content and temperature), soil nutrient supply (i.e., NH4 +, NO3 ? ), and organic C availability. Simulation results also showed that at this site, GHG emissions did not vary significantly between monitoring locations, suggesting that the ditch slopes are not significant GHG emission hotspots. Both major rainfall events and warmer summer temperatures led to the development of hot moments for CO2 and N2O emissions and corresponding soil gas concentrations. Although the uniform model was successful in reproducing long-term trends in observed data, the model was not able to fully capture in-season temporal variability of fluxes and concentrations related to acute precipitation events (i.e., hot moments). Nevertheless, the modeling approach presented shows promise for future studies comparing the effect of management styles for agricultural soils and drainage ditch zones on GHG emissions and uptake."
781;From cropland to cropped field: A robust algorithm for national-scale mapping by fusing time series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2;"Bingwen Qiu a,* , Duoduo Lin a , Chongcheng Chen a , Peng Yang b , Zhenghong Tang c , Zhenong Jin d , Zhiyan Ye a , Xiaolin Zhu e , Mingjie Duan e , Hongyu Huang a , Zhiyuan Zhao a , Weiming Xu a , Zuoqi Chen a";"Detailed and updated maps of actively cropped fields on a national scale are vital for global food security. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in existing land cover datasets, especially lacking in smallholder farmer systems. Mapping national-scale cropped fields remains challenging due to the spectral confusion with abandoned vegetated land, and their high heterogeneity over large areas. This study proposed a large-area mapping framework for automatically identifying actively cropped fields by fusing Vegetation-Soil-Pigment indices and Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) time-series images (VSPS). Three temporal indicators were proposed and highlighted cropped fields by consistently higher values due to cropping activities. The proposed VSPS algorithm was exploited for national-scale mapping in China without regional adjustments using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 images. Agriculture in China illustrated great heterogeneity and has experienced tremendous changes such as non-grain orientation and cropland abandonment. Yet, little is known about the locations and extents of cropped fields cultivated with field crops on a national scale. Here, we produced the first national-scale 20 m updated map of cropped and fallow/abandoned land in China and found that 77 % of national cropland (151.23 million hectares) was actively cropped in 2020. We found that fallow/abandoned cropland in mountainous and hilly regions were far more than we expected, which was significantly underestimated by the commonly applied VImax-based approach based on the MODIS images. The VSPS method illustrates robust generalization capabilities, which obtained an overall accuracy of 94 % based on 4,934 widely spread reference sites. The proposed mapping framework is capable of detecting cropped fields with a full consideration of a high diversity of cropping systems and complexity of fallow/abandoned cropland. The processing codes on Google Earth Engine were provided and hoped to stimulate operational agricultural mapping on cropped fields with finer resolution from the national to the global scale."
782;Integrating sustainability indicators and governance structures via clustering analysis and multicriteria decision making for an urban agriculture network;"Andrea Valencia a , Jiangxiao Qiu b , Ni-Bin Chang a";"Environmental, social, and economic sustainability patterns interact in various dimensions of an urban environment. Exacerbated population growth triggers an emphasis on better resource management strategies addressing the balance of supply and demand over food, energy, and water sectors while considering social and economic development. Promoting sustainable development goals requires governance structures and functions within and across the food, energy, and water sectors, specifically due to polycentric urban development. This study emphasizes food security via an urban agriculture network in the greater Miami metropolitan area, encompassing the three counties of Palm-Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade. Given the existing governance structure, we quantified several sustainability indices for clustering analysis to agglomerate urban agricultural sites (UASs) and to help identify the priority of clusters in terms of vulnerability or risk level according to their priority index in multicriteria decision-making. The cases of eight clusters were selected for the visualization of the UASs ranked by multicriteria decision-making based on scenarios prioritized for governance under the impacts of climate change, social equity, and economic development. The role of governance structure was highlighted for signifying the incentive programs to enhance the overall sustainability performance of UASs in an urban food?energy?water nexus."
783;Arkansas producers value upload speed more than download speed for precision agriculture applications;"Jacob L. Manlove a,* , Aaron M. Shew b , Oladipo S. Obembe a";"While access to broadband services has increased in recent years, many agricultural producers remain without access or are served by an inadequate connection. As many precision agriculture applications rely on data transfer through broadband networks, the expansion of broadband into rural areas has become critical for farm modernization. This study recruited Arkansas agriculture producers to complete a choice experiment on their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a broadband connection. We examine factors influencing producers? WTP for broadband upload and download speed using a conditional logit model. In the evaluation of WTP for broadband, producers were willing to pay on average $1.07 to $1.34 per Mbps (megabits per second) of upload speed, compared to $0.02 to $0.03 per Mbps of download speed. Producers also placed a premium on the reliability of the connection. These results suggest that producers value a symmetrical data flow for production operations to support precision agriculture applications."
784;Evolution of dietary structure and its living environment effect: A study in the agricultural area of ?Yarlung Zangbo River and its two tributaries? on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau;"Yuanyuan Zhu a,1 , Lingen Wang b,1 , Yan Zhang a,1 , Xiaohua Zhu b";"Exploring the evolution of residents? dietary structure and its effects on the living environment is significant for realizing the global sustainable goal. This study constructed a theoretical framework to explore the relationship between diet structure and living environment, took the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region as the research object, analyzed the evolution characteristics of the dietary structure, and used the carbon emission coefficient method and the introduction of virtual water and virtual land concepts to investigate the living environment effects of dietary structure evolution. The results showed that from 2010 to 2018, the dietary structure of residents in the ?Yarlung Zangbo River and its two tributaries? agricultural area on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau evolved from a plant-based diet to a diversified diet. The burden on the living environment gradually weakened with the dietary structure evolution. Compared to 2010, per capita food carbon emissions and water and land resources consumption decreased by 27.2%, 24.5%, and 15.8%, respectively. However, compared with the balanced diet model of the Chinese Dietary Guidelines 2022, the food carbon emissions in the study area increased significantly by 29.4%, land resource utilization increased by 2.5%, and water resource utilization gradually approached the critical value. Furthermore, we found that regions with high meat consumption put more burden on the living environment. Therefore, we suggest that encouraging residents to reduce meat consumption and optimize diet structure may be an effective way to achieve a sustainable living environment in the future."
785;Environmental assessment of vegetable crops towards the water-energy-food nexus: A combination of precision agriculture and life cycle assessment;"Adriana Del Borghi a,* , Valeria Tacchino a , Luca Moreschi a , Agata Matarazzo b , Michela Gallo a , Diego Arellano Vazquez a,c";"The increase in world population and the resulting demand for food, water and energy are exerting increasing pressure on soil, water resources and ecosystems. Identification of tools to minimise the related environmental impacts within the food?energy?water nexus is, therefore, crucial. The purpose of the study is to carry out an analysis of the agri-food sector in order to improve the energy-environmental performance of four vegetable crops (beans, peas, sweet corn, tomato) through a combination of precision agriculture (PA) and life cycle assessment (LCA). Thus, PA strategies were identified and a full LCA was performed on actual and future scenarios for all crops in order to evaluate the benefits of a potential combination of these two tools. In the case study analysed, a life cycle approach was able to target water consumption as a key parameter for the reduced water availability of future climate scenarios and to set a multi-objective function combining also such environmental aspects to the original goal of yield maximisation. As a result, the combination of PA with the LCA perspective potentially allowed the path for an optimal trade-off of all the parameters involved and an overall reduction of the expected environmental impacts in future climate scenarios."
786;Definition of optimal agricultural plastic waste collection centers with advanced spatial analysis tools;"Phoebe-Zoe Morsink-Georgali * , Nicholas Afxentiou, Angeliki Kylili, Paris A. Fokaides";"The volumes of agricultural plastic waste (APW) generated are continuously rising, creating the need for sustainable management, especially in countries with large agricultural areas. This paper proposes a location allocation model for the establishment of centers for process and recycling of APW, presenting an enormous opportunity for the plastics manufacturing industry. The proposed model was tested with data retrieved for the case of Cyprus, an island EU member state well renowned for its agricultural production. Under this context, the greenhouses in Cyprus were categorized in clusters based on their geographical dispersion and mapped with the use of geographical information system (GIS). The GIS tool also enabled the calculation of the annual APW generation. An optimized design of the APW supply chain, which achieves the lowest energy needs, was delivered. Non-Linear Programming was employed to indicate the optimal locations for the establishment of collection points within each cluster and province of the island as well as the theoretical optimal geographic location for the establishment of an APW recycling plant in the island state. Based on the location-allocation analysis findings, design specifications for the APW recycling units are also proposed."
787;Agricultural production under rural tourism on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: From the perspective of smallholder farmers;"Yang Lun a , Sun Jing b , Liu Moucheng a , Min Qingwen a,c";"Rural tourism has been the leading alternative livelihood of farmers on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in recent years. However, the trade-off between agricultural production and rural tourism has been gradually serious. Therefore, we selected the Zhagana Village, an example of rural tourism on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, to discuss the agricultural production under rural tourism from smallholder farmers? perspective, and analyze its existence severity of the trade-off. Based on the comparative analysis of smallholder farmers? agricultural production behavior (including the production scale, agricultural input, agricultural output, and production efficiency), we reviewed the agricultural production in the whole study region in 2005?2019. The results show a certain degree of trade-off between agricultural production and rural tourism on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. At the level of smallholder farmers, under the background of rural tourism development, agricultural production efficiency (mainly the production efficiency of grassland) has significantly increased due to the further expansion of the scale of livestock husbandry by smallholder farmers. At the regional level, with the development of rural tourism, the regional production structure has gradually changed from the integrated management of farming, forestry, and animal husbandry into the mode of taking animal husbandry as a dominant industry, farming and forestry as supplementary industries, but the regional agricultural productivity has not been stagnated or weakened."
788;Climate change and ecological intensification of agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa ? A systems approach to predict maize yield under push-pull technology;"Nikolaos Alexandridis a,1,* , Benjamin Feit b,1 , Job Kihara c , Tim Luttermoser d , Wilhelm May a , Charles Midega e,f , Ingrid Oborn ? g , Katja Poveda d , Gudeta W. Sileshi h,i , Beyene Zewdie j , Yann Clough a,2 , Mattias Jonsson b,2";"Assessing effects of climate change on agricultural systems and the potential for ecological intensification to increase food security in developing countries is essential to guide management, policy-making and future research. ?Push-pull? technology (PPT) is a poly-cropping design developed in eastern Africa that utilizes plant chemicals to mediate plant?insect interactions. PPT application yields significant increases in crop productivity, by reducing pest load and damage caused by arthropods and parasitic weeds, while also bolstering soil fertility. As climate change effects may be species- and/or context-specific, there is need to elucidate how, in interaction with biotic factors, projected climate conditions are likely to influence future functioning of PPT. Here, we first reviewed how changes in temperature, precipitation and atmospheric CO2 concentration can influence PPT components (i.e., land use, soils, crops, weeds, diseases, pests and their natural enemies) across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We then imposed these anticipated responses on a landscape-scale qualitative mathematical model of maize production under PPT in eastern Africa, to predict cumulative, structure-mediated impacts of climate change on maize yield. Our review suggests variable impacts of climate change on PPT components in SSA by the end of the 21st century, including reduced soil fertility, increased weed and arthropod pest pressure and increased prevalence of crop diseases, but also increased biological control by pests? natural enemies. Extrapolating empirical evidence of climate effects to predict responses to projected climate conditions is mainly limited by a lack of mechanistic understanding regarding single and interactive effects of climate variables on PPT components. Model predictions of maize yield responses to anticipated impacts of climate change in eastern Africa suggest predominantly negative future trends. Nevertheless, maize yields can be sustained or increased by favourable changes in system components with less certain future behaviour, including higher PPT adoption, preservation of field edge density and agricultural diversification beyond cereal crops."
789;Adaptive feature fusion pyramid network for multi-classes agricultural pest detection;"Lin Jiao a,* , Chengjun Xie b , Peng Chen c , Jianming Du b,* , Rui Li b , Jie Zhang b";"The accurate and robust crop pest detection system is an important step to enable the reliable forecasting of agricultural pest in the community of precision agriculture, attracting great attention in many countries. For achieving the automatic recognition and detection of agricultural pest, previous methods adopt image processing-based methods, leading to lower efficiency. Then, machine vision-based methods are introduced into crop pest detection by using hand-crafted feature descriptors, improving the detection precision and speed. However, the manual feature is powerless for precise recognition. Considering powerful ability of feature extraction of convolutional neural network(CNN), we have developed a CNN-based method for multi-classes pest detection under complex scenes. In this paper, an adaptive feature fusion is introduced into feature pyramid network for extracting richer pest features. Then, an adaptive augmentation module has been developed for reducing the information loss of the highest-level feature maps. Finally, a two-stage region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) was built for refining predicted bounding boxes, which can obtain the categories and locations of pests of each image. We have conducted large quantities of comparison experiments on AgriPest21 dataset. Our method could achieve an accuracy of 77.0%, which significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, including SSD, RetinaNet, FPN, Dynamic R-CNN, and Cascade R-CNN."
790;Evaluation of management practices on agricultural nonpoint source pollution discharges into the rivers under climate change effects;"Nasrin Badrzadeh a , Jamal Mohammad Vali Samani a , Mehdi Mazaheri a , Alban Kuriqi b,c,?";"In recent years, agricultural non-point source pollution (ANPSP) has become the biggest threat to Aras River water quality by completing the Mughan irrigation and drainage network. Nutrient pollutants, including nitrate and phosphate, released into the river through drains have created a range of obstacles for locals living around the river. Agricultural activities are generally considered the largest source of non-point pollution. They have no complex and uniform impact along the river. Thus, the spatial distribution of ANPS and highly polluted areas should be identified to manage watershed management. This study proposes a simple framework for identifying pollutant-sensitive areas along the river and management strategies to improve water quality. To this aim, the main factors affecting ANPSP were identified, and the effectiveness of the scenarios selected to comply with water quality regulations for drinking and environment during 1993?2007 were simulated. Based on the sensitivity analysis, land use and fertilizer are the main factors affecting river ANPSP. Thus, their changes were modeled in different scenarios. Based on the results, the ANPSP load was higher downstream. The agricultural lands in region 3 were considered the main source of pollution. Comparing the management scenarios showed that the amount of nitrate and phosphate leaching into the river decreased to 18.1 and 8.35 %, respectively, by reducing the consumption of urea and phosphate fertilizers by 50 %. The results help watershed managers implement eco-friendly land use and nutrient management programs at specific locations during specific periods to control ANPSP along the rivers."
791;Agricultural trade shocks and carbon leakage: Evidence from China?s trade shocks to the Belt & Road economies;"Jiangfeng Hu, Zhao Wang, Qinghua Huang, Mengjia Hu *";"Existing literature on carbon leakage mostly focused on polluting industries or at the national level. Agriculture is one of the main sources of carbon emissions, however, research on agricultural carbon leakage is still insufficient. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the impact of China?s agricultural trade shocks on carbon emissions in a panel of 62 economies along the Belt and Road (B&R) over the period 1990?2017. The results show that China?s supply shocks have a significant inhibitory effect on the agricultural carbon emissions of the B&R economies, and this inhibitory effect is very stable and will not be disturbed by other factors. On the contrary, China?s demand shocks only have a significant inhibitory effect on the carbon emission intensity of economies with a higher proportion of agriculture, but it will significantly increase the agricultural carbon emissions share in all economies."
792;Role of existing and emerging technologies in advancing climate-smart agriculture through modeling: A review;"Debaditya Gupta a , Nihal Gujre a,b , Siddhartha Singha a , Sudip Mitra a";"Under changing climate and burgeoning food production demands, climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices are the need of the hour. Physically-based crop models have been designed, which require large sets of input variables, besides being timeworn, tedious, and not user-friendly in the current situation. There is a rapid advancement in the modeling approaches in agricultural practices. But, still, there is a shortage of comprehensive information related to the recent technological advancement in the modeling applications toward CSA and its prospects. The paper reviews, critically assess, and discusses the present state-of-art modeling technologies related to the CSA. Special emphasis is placed on highlighting the current research trends in the different crop simulation models and their CSA applications. The assessment and analysis of the combined implications of crop simulation and hydrological models form another vital area of our review. Subsequently, the suitability and future scope of AI in crop simulation models is thoroughly assessed. Finally, the ways to address future challenges for CSA through the models and AI-based approaches are evaluated. We have selected and critically reviewed the literature to deliberate on the various aspects of modeling and their impact on CSA. Overall, we attempted to distinctly bring out the different latest and advanced technologies and their potential roles in modeling exercises towards CSA. The current review also collates and presents new and innovative modeling approaches toward CSA with techno-feasible solutions. The review involves the simulation-optimization framework for coupling hydrological and climate models with crop models that presently have the utmost importance for the CSA. Concurrently it also highlights the overarching significance of different models and suggests refined solutions that enable better crop and environment estimation, field management, and decisionmaking."
793;Agricultural drought vulnerability assessment and diagnosis based on entropy fuzzy pattern recognition and subtraction set pair potential;"Rongxing Zhou, Juliang Jin, Yi Cui *, Shaowei Ning, Xia Bai, Libing Zhang, Yuliang Zhou, Chengguo Wu, Fang Tong";"The assessment and diagnosis of agricultural drought vulnerability is the basis for the scientific control and prevention of agricultural drought risk. In order to quantitatively evaluate the regional agricultural drought vulnerability and effectively deal with the fuzziness and randomness between evaluation sample and evaluation grade, the entropy fuzzy pattern recognition model, which was coupled with maximum information entropy principle and fuzzy pattern recognition method, was applied to the evaluation of agricultural drought vulnerability. Furthermore, in order to find methods to reduce drought vulnerability, the subtraction set pair potential method was used to further identify the main influence factors of agricultural drought vulnerability. In addition, a case study was carried out in Bengbu City, China. The results showed that during the period from 2001 to 2010, the evaluation value of agricultural drought vulnerability in Bengbu dropped from grade IV to III, which meant that the tolerance of agricultural system to drought had been improved. Moreover, the main factors that affected the vulnerability in Bengbu were precipitation, water use efficiency and irrigation protection area rate. And the latter two were the main objects of regulation and control. Compared with the other three methods, the physical concept of drought vulnerability assessment model based on entropy fuzzy pattern recognition is more obvious, and the evaluation results are reasonable and credible. The drought vulnerability diagnosis method based on subtraction set pair potential can accurately identify key influence factor and provide measures to reduce drought vulnerability and improve drought risk management."
794;Food insecurity and sovereignty threat to uncontrolled price spillover effects in financialized agricultural products: The red meat case in Turkiye;"Faruk Urak 1, *, Abdulbaki Bilgic 2";"The objective of this study is to examine the long-term uncertainty transmission between cattle and lamb carcass markets and the feed wheat market in terms of exogenous variables (e.g., gasoline price, exchange rate, and import variables) and whether the volatility is symmetrical, using the daily data from January 2005 to June 2019, and VAR (1)?BEKK?GARCH (1, 1) Model. The empirical results indicate that short- and longterm indirect and direct shocks and long-term uncertainty propagation significantly affect the conditional variances of the beef carcass, lamb carcass, and feed wheat returns, which poses a threat to producers in terms of product sovereignty and consumers in terms of food security. We also discovered that the conditional variances of the beef carcass, lamb carcass, and feed wheat returns were significantly affected by any increase in foreign exchange rates in times of import in comparison with those in the times of nonimport. Similarly, the fluctuations in the energy (gasoline) market increased the ongoing risk propagations in the lamb carcass and feed wheat markets, whereas they decreased it in the beef carcass market. Meanwhile, asymmetrical effects played a role in uncertainty in transitions for product markets. Additionally, the optimal portfolio weight of beef carcasses on lamb carcasses and feed wheat was 0.645 and 0.553, respectively, whereas the optimal portfolio weight of lamb carcasses on feed wheat remained at approximately 0.188."
795;Effects of different cropping systems on ammonia nitrogen load in a typical agricultural watershed of South China;"Jie Jiang a , Jun Li a , Zhaoli Wang a,* , Xushu Wu a , Chengguang Lai a , Xiaohong Chen b";"The excessive application of agricultural irrigation water and chemical fertilizer has increased crop yields to help meet the demand for food, but it has also led to major water environment problem, i.e. non-point source (NPS) pollution, which needs to be addressed to achieve sustainable development targets. Although numerous studies have focused on the control and reduction of agricultural NPS pollution from the perspective of irrigation and fertilizer, the effects of different cropping systems on NPS pollution (ammonia nitrogen (NH3- N)) in the Dongjiang River Basin (DRB) were seldom assessed. Specifically, variation in the NH3-N load was simulated and analyzed at the annual and semi-annual scales under ten different cropping systems using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, which was calibrated and validated with satisfactory statistical index values in the DRB. The results indicated that the NH3-N load decreased, distinctly increased, slightly decreased when sweet potato, peanut, and rice were planted, respectively. Compared with mono-cropping, crop rotation could reduce the NH3-N load, and the planting sequence of crops could affect the NH3-N load to a certain extent. Planting peanuts in spring would dramatically increase NH3-N load. To evaluate NH3-N pollution, a critical threshold of NH3-N emission (5.1 kg?ha- 1 ?year- 1 ) was proposed. Meeting the NH3-N emission threshold cannot be achieved by altering the cropping system alone additional measures are needed to reduce agricultural NPS pollution. This study facilitates the development of cropping systems and provides relevant information to aid the sustainable development of agriculture in the DRB."

Lauffenburger a,* , Marco P. Maneta a,c , Kelly M. Cobourn b , Kelsey Jencso c , Brian Chaffin c , Anna Crockett c , Bruce Maxwell d , John S. Kimball c";"Study region,Montana, U.S.A. Study focus Creating adaptation plans for projected imbalances in the western U.S. agricultural water demand-supply system are difficult given uncertainty in climate projections. It is critical to understand the uncertainties and vulnerabilities of the regional agricultural system and hydrologic impacts of climate change adaptation. We applied a stochastic, integrated hydro-economic model that simulates land and water allocations to analyse Montana farmer adaptations to a range of projected climate conditions and the response of the hydrologic system to those adaptations. Satellite observations of crop types, productivity, water use, and land allocation were used for model calibration. A suite of climate models was employed to quantify end-of-century impacts on streamflows, water and land use, production, and net revenues.New hydrological insights for the region Simulations showed summer streamflows were influenced by a state-wide 18.2% increase in agricultural water use. Decreased summer water availability with increased demand could have far reaching impacts downstream. Land use for irrigated crops increased 1.6%, while rainfed crops decreased 6.5%, implying state-level decrease in planted area. Even with increased land and water use for irrigated crops, production decreased 0.5%, while rainfed production decreased 2.7%. Corresponding losses in net revenues totaled 1.5% and 7.2% for irrigated and rainfed crops, respectively.Results highlight vulnerabilities of semi-arid agricultural regions and can aid water managers in sustaining agriculture in these regions."
797;Acoustics applied in the development of equipment for precision agriculture: Coffee handling and harvesting;"Geovanne P. Furriel a,b,* , Brunna C.R.S. Furriel a,c , Antonio ? P. Coimbra d , Wesley P. Calixto a,c";"This work presents a methodology for developing two types of equipment for precision agriculture applied in coffee handling and harvesting, based on acoustic techniques. The proposed methodology uses the similitude method to simulate induced vibration and the direction of sound pressure fields. After analyzing the scale reduction model, a prototype is built in real dimensions to validate the proposed system. Two acoustic induction systems are evaluated: (i) application of phytosanitary products and (ii) selective harvesting of fruits. In applying a phytosanitary product, there is a drift reduction and increase in leaf coverage by approximately 44.97%. In selective harvesting, the proposed method is analyzed, and approximately 40% of the fruits in the appropriate ripening stage were harvested. The presented acoustic techniques applied to agriculture are promising for developing equipment in precision coffee handling and harvesting. The results obtained indicate that using acoustic techniques in the harvest promotes the reduction of the inherent wear of the harvest in the plants."
798;Pathways to Agricultural Decarbonization: Climate Change Obstacles and Opportunities in the US;"Robert Sroufe a,* , Alec Watts b";"This study looks at the agriculture industry in the United States (US), waves of innovation, and scenario planning for decarbonization. First, a review of the field looks at prior work highlighting metrics and goals for decarbonization. We next provide a synthesis of material obstacles and opportunities within this industry sector. Then, based on an understanding of the field, we utilize scenario planning to understand ?how can we plan for decarbonizing the agricultural industry in the US in the next 10 to 25 years?? To help answer this question, we identify and rank drivers of change, uncertainty, and impact of these drivers. We then demonstrate how this industry?s decision-makers can plan for pathways while navigating obstacles and opportunities to an uncertain future. Finally, we identify four scenarios providing plausible pathways to a future that is different from business as usual and able to generate trillions of dollars of value across industries. The study is with a call to action for decision makers to put this industry on a different path than it has been on for the last 100 years. We see opportunities for researchers to conduct more studies on emission policies, valuing CO2 emissions, along with investments in infrastructure, public-private partnerships, and government incentives for decarbonization in the context of applying scenario planning across industries."
799;Multifractal analysis of China?s agricultural commodity futures markets;"Zhihui Lia , Xinsheng Lub";"We investigate the multifractal characteristics of the volatility time series from China?s agricultural commodity futures markets, using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis and multifractal spectrum analysis. We find that prominent multifractal features exit in China?s major agricultural commodity futures markets, including the Hard Winter Wheat (HW) futures, the Strong Gluten Wheat (SG) futures, Soy Bean (SB) futures and corn futures. Furthermore, the multifractality strength and multifractal spectrum width of HW futures are both bigger than that of SG, SB and corn futures, implying that the market risk for HW futures might be the strongest among all the four futures contracts. Finally, comparing empirical results of shuffling and surrogate data, we also find that nonlinear temporal correlations instead of non-Gaussian distribution constitute the major contributions in the formation of multifractal features in these four agricultural commodity futures markets."
800;"An improved fuzzy sorting algorithm coupling bi-level programming for synergetic optimization of agricultural water resources: A case study of Fujian Province, China";"Yang Cheng a , Lei Jin a,* , Yalei Pan a , Ruolin Bai a , Yi Wei a , Guohe Huang b";"The uneven allocation of water resources and the shortage of regional water resources pose great challenges to the economic development and regional development balance of the Fujian province. Optimizing the water allocation structure in different regions can effectively alleviate water pressure. In this study, a type-2 fuzzy bilevel programming (T2FBL) method is proposed to plan the agricultural water resource system in the Fujian province. This method uses an improved fuzzy sorting algorithm to deal with uncertain parameters in the system and combines the bi-level programming method to balance the trade-off between two levels of decision-makers, the uncertain information contained in the secondary membership function omitted in the interval type-2 fuzzy theory is considered in the new ranking algorithm. Multiple scenarios related to different food security needs and different risk indices are examined. The major findings are as follows: (i) With an average tolerance of 75%, the average gross agricultural output value under various scenarios increased (0.4% ~ 7%) (average 3.89%) after optimization. (ii) The regional water allocation scheme under different food demands and different water availability scenarios is calculated, and the results show that prioritizing adjustments to the industrial water distribution structure of Fuzhou and Zhangzhou will greatly relieve the water pressure in the Fujian province. (iii) The relationship between the availability of system water resources and economic benefits is given through the calculation results of the T2FBL model. These findings can provide an in-depth understanding of the interaction between agricultural, industrial and tertiary industry water allocation and provide technical support for agricultural water resource planning issues."
801;Review of the internet of things communication technologies in smart agriculture and challenges;"Wen Tao a , Liang Zhao a,b,* , Guangwen Wang a , Ruobing Liang c";"The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) spurred a new direction of research in agriculture, and various IoT communication technologies are used to connect with different devices in different layers. With the rapid increasing number of studies and projects about IoT-based smart agriculture, information got scattered and the involved communication technologies were not been analyzed and discussed before in other reviews. Intending to identify and review scientifically validated literature on IoT communication technologies in smart agriculture, this study critically summarizes the recent research pertinent to the smart agriculture with IoT communication technologies. The employed method was a thorough search from these three databases, namely: ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus. Total 94 research articles were reviewed after the total of 886 titles being scanned for relevance. The monitored parameters by sensors and communication technologies associated with IoT-based smart agriculture applications are analyzed comprehensively, as well as some specific issues, challenges, and recommendations in IoT applications in agriculture. The study provides reference for researchers, and more burgeoning communication technologies should be applied in agriculture to realize the great-leap forward development in smart agriculture."
802;Effect of land tenure fragmentation on the decision-making and scale of agricultural land transfer in China;"Yu CAO*, Jie Zou, Xiaoqian Fang, Jiayi Wang, Yu Cao, Guoyu Li";"This study uses a logistic model and multiple linear regression model to quantitatively study the impact of land tenure fragmentation on land transfer decision-making and scale at a single time point and in a time series. This study used the Chinese Family Database as a sample, and selected the number of plots and the average plot area to reflect the level of land tenure fragmentation. The results show that at a single time point the land tenure fragmentation has a significant positive effect on the transfer decision and a significant negative effect on the transfer scale. In the time series, the land tenure fragmentation does not affect the decision of households, but it has a significant negative impact on the transfer scale. Meanwhile, the study results at a single time point are affected by the particularity of the sample and the difference in external conditions at different time points. Therefore, when studying land transfer decisions, we should focus more on the initial state of land tenure. When studying the scale of land transfer, we should pay attention to both the current status of tenure fragmentation and the change in tenure fragmentation. The characteristics of families and communities also affect the transfer decision and scale however, the factors are different, and the same factors may affect the decision and scale in the opposite direction."
803;Analysis on the change of tourists leisure agricultural tourism behavior and the influence of individual intrinsic characteristics;"Mao Shuai a , Chunmeng Liu a, * , Faroq Ahmed a, b, **, Ranran Wang a";"With the development of leisure agriculture and consumer behavior, more attention should be paid to consumer experience. Based on the data of 2004 and 2019, this paper makes a comparative analysis on the tourism behavior of leisure agricultural tourists in Xuzhou, studies the process of behavior change, and uses the Heckman two-step model to analyze the impact of tourists internal characteristics on the consumption behavior of leisure agricultural tourists.

804;"Prolonged duration and increased severity of agricultural droughts during 1978 to 2016 detected by ESA CCI SM in the humid Yunnan Province, Southwest China";"Siyu Ma a,b , Shiqiang Zhang a,b,* , Ninglian Wang a,b , Chang Huang a,b , Xin Wang c";"Droughts in humid regions may have more severe consequences owing to a lack of drought-resistant measures and awareness. The Yunnan Province, in the humid southwestern part of China, experienced an extreme drought from 2009 to 2010. However, few studies have systematically explored agricultural droughts in this region. Based on revised global multi-source microwave-based SM products, the European Space Agency?s Climate Change Initiative Soil Moisture (ESA CCI SM) data, the 10-day-scale soil moisture (SM) series was constructed and applied to detect droughts and analyze changes in drought characteristics, including duration, area, frequency, intensity, and severity. The results suggest that the intensity of agricultural drought in the Yunnan Province decreased, while the drought frequency increased. Drought duration increased by 20 days, collectively leading to a significant increase in drought severity in the last decade. Qujing in the east was most sensitive to agricultural drought, followed by Kunming and Chuxiong in the central area. The southwest region was prone to long drought and maintained an upward trend in terms of drought area. Regional SM with complicated temporalspatial change patterns cannot be attributed to a single trend of ?dry to dryer, wet to wetter?. This study may provide insights into drought analysis in other humid regions."
805;Analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the correlations between crude oil and agricultural futures;"Jian Wanga , Wei Shao b , Junseok Kima,*";"In this study, we explored the impact of COVID-19 on the cross-correlations between crude oil and agricultural futures markets. A multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA) approach was utilized to analyze the cross-correlations between the Brent crude oil and agricultural futures such as London Sugar, London Wheat, USA Cotton #2, and USA Orange Juice futures. We initially confirmed their correlations by calculating the DCCA coefficient. Then, from the multifractal aspect, the cross-correlations were further explored, and the sources for forming the correlations were discussed. The results show that the Brent Crude Oil has the strongest cross-correlation with London Sugar Future market among other three agricultural future markets. Then we investigated the influence of COVID-19 on the crosscorrelations of multifractality between crude oil and agricultural futures. The experimental results indicated that the persistence under the influence of COVID-19 became stronger, and the cross-correlations of multifractality between crude oil and sugar future market is the strongest. In addition, the crosscorrelations of all the agricultural futures increased after the emergence of COVID-19 except the orange juice future market. In general, COVID-19 has a great impact on the cross-correlation of multifractal property between crude oil and most selected agricultural future markets."
806;Advances in the simulation of nutrient dynamics in cold climate agricultural basins: Developing new nitrogen and phosphorus modules for the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling Platform;"Diogo Costa a,* , John W. Pomeroy b , Tom Brown b , Helen Baulch b , Jane Elliott a , Merrin Macrae c";"Excess nutrients in aquatic ecosystems is a major water quality problem globally. Worsening eutrophication issues are notable in cold temperate areas, with pervasive problems in many agriculturally dominated catchments. Predicting nutrient export to rivers and lakes is particularly difficult in cold agricultural environments because of challenges in modelling snow, soil, frozen ground, climate, and anthropogenic controls. Previous research has shown that the use of many popular small basin nutrient models can be problematic in cold regions due to poor representation of cold region hydrology. In this study, the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling Platform (CRHM), a modular modelling system, which has been widely deployed across Canada and cold regions worldwide, was used to address this problem. CRHM was extended to simulate biogeochemical and transport processes for nitrogen and phosphorus through a complex of new process-based modules that represent physicochemical processes in snow, soil and freshwater. Agricultural practices such as tillage and fertilizer application, which strongly impact the availability and release of soil nutrients, can be explicitly represented in the model. A test case in an agricultural basin draining towards Lake Winnipeg shows that the model can capture the extreme hydrology and nutrient load variability of small agricultural basins at hourly time steps. It was demonstrated that fine temporal resolutions are an essential modelling requisite to capture strong concentration changes in agricultural tributaries in cold agricultural environments. Within these ephemeral and intermittent streams, on average, 30%, 31%, 20%, and 16% of the total annual load of nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and particulate phosphorous (partP)NO3, NH4, SRP and partP occurred during the episodic snowmelt freshet (~9 days, accounting for 21% of the annual flow), but shows extreme temporal variation. The new nutrient modules are critical tools for predicting nutrient export from small agricultural drainage basins in cold climates via better representation of key hydrological processes, and a temporal resolution more suited to capture dynamics of ephemeral and intermittent streams."
807;Wastewater treatment focused on the reuse and provision of agricultural supplies: Combination of phosphate adsorption and microbial reduction;"Diana Guaya a,* , Gianella Cuenca a , Eda Mendoza a , Matteo Radice b , Ximena Jaramillo-Fierro a , Eduardo Valarezo a";"The efficiency of wastewater treatment systems is measured in terms of physicochemical and biological parameters. In this study two-stages of treatment were evaluated for the phosphate and microbial removal from wastewater for agricultural purposes. Iron (oxy)hydroxide was incorporated into a natural clay for phosphate removal and essential oils (Eucalyptus globulus and Citrus limon) were used for microbial reduction from wastewater. An overall experimental evaluation was performed from synthetic wastewater and further validated in real wastewater in batch mode. Phosphate adsorption capacity of iron (oxy)hydroxide clay (PMFe5) was three times higher than parent clay (PMFe1). Phosphate removal by PMFe5 was effective at neutral pH, which is attributed to physical and chemical adsorption mechanisms by means of hydrogen bonding adsorption and chemical complexation reactions, respectively. PMFe5 removed phosphate and ammonium at 65.8% and 72.3%, respectively from real wastewater. On the other hand, the use of emulsions of Eucalyptus globulus and Citrus limon essential oils allowed the decrease of bacterial load from wastewater. The microbial reduction was more effective using Eucalyptus globulus than Citrus limon essential oil. The fecal and total coliforms were reduced to a maximum extent of 100% using Eucalyptus globulus at 100 mg L- 1 . Microbial content was reduced to 100% using Citrus limon at 1000 mg L- 1 . Thus, reusability of wastewater for irrigation purposes is possible using an iron clay and essential oils. The use of PMFe5 as tertiary treatment stage could be crucial to recover phosphate?phosphorous from wastewater treatment plants reaching the regulatory levels. The content of total and fecal coliforms was also efficiently reduced using essential oils. On one hand, wastewater can be reused in irrigation activities according to the water quality standards. On the other hand, a nutrient enriched material can be provided as phosphate source for soil amendment application. The combination of both treatment technologies provides important agricultural supplies."
808;"The impact of forest restoration on agriculture in the Verde River watershed, Arizona, USA";"Xiaobing Zhaoa,? , Ding Dua , Jun Xiongb , Abraham Springerc , Sharon R. Masek Lopezd , Blake Winklere , Kenedy Hublerf";"Known as the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), the US Forest Service is planning a large-scale restoration of ponderosa pine forests in the Verde River watershed in central Arizona, USA. This paper uses a reduced-form econometric regression model with 1969?2010 time-series data to estimate the economic benefits of the increased water yield due to planned forest restoration of the first phase of 4FRI. We split the data sample into 1969?1989 and 1990?2010 time periods, and conclude during the second time period, water use is statistically and economically significant. This is consistent with the reality that the Verde River watershed has been in drought since the early 1990s. Our central finding is, if water use increases by 1%, the farm income will increase by 1.33%. If a 5?10% increase in water yield caused by the first phase of the 4FRI is all used by agriculture, agricultural income will increase by 6.65?13.3% annually"
809;Sustainable agriculture by the Internet of Things ? A practitioner?s approach to monitor sustainability progress;"Sjaak Wolfert * , Gohar Isakhanyan";"Sustainability is a major challenge in agri-food systems. Digital technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT) hold substantial promises for attaining the sustainability goals of the economy, environment and society at large. However, in practice it is difficult to evaluate to which extent these technologies contribute to sustainable development raising doubts about their impact. This paper demonstrates a stepwise approach that allows for measuring and monitoring IoT contribution to sustainability in a real-life context. The UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) underpin the principles of the approach by a typology and by framing the sustainability impact in terms of business opportunities. The approach has been developed and evaluated by 33 use cases in the EU-funded IoF2020 project. The research illustrates how the measurement and monitoring tool is applied in 5 of these use cases from different agricultural subsectors showing how the approach is applied and validated. The results indicate an overall positive impact of IoT on improving sustainability, although these results are also partly determined by other influential external factors that cannot be easily discerned in a practical situation. The main contribution of this approach is the set of instruments for practitioners to measure and monitor the impact of fast-changing technologies such as IoT to sustainability in a real-life context. This set of instruments can also be used by other stakeholders in large IoT projects where strategic sustainability objectives should be supported by IoT solutions. The stepwise approach is easy to communicate and supports stakeholders such as farmers in decision-making, but also policy makers and investors in funding projects."
810;Composites of thermoplastic starch/natural rubber blends for fertilizer-releasing in agriculture;"Yeampon Nakaramontri a,* , Yeiangchart Boonluksiri a , Phakhwan Sornsri a , Sirijanya Duangkhaw a , Phuwadon Udompongpaiboon b , Jobish Johns c , Lompong Klinnawee b,d,*";"Thermoplastic starch (TPS) based on the mixture of cassava starch and glycerol was prepared and blended with the natural rubber (NR) and epoxidized NR (ENR). The resulting blend was further filled with fertilizer grade 16?16?16. The effects of fertilizer concentration on the properties of the blends and the growthability of maize seedling were investigated and characterized. In case of the specific properties of the blends, it was found that the blends based on NR and ENR matrices exhibited a reduction in tensile properties upon increasing the fertilizer concentration, while the solubility, water absorption and biodegrability were improved. In particular, the blends of TPS/ENR with fertilizer showed better properties than that of the blend with NR due to the physical interaction of hydrogen bonding among the polymer molecules as confirmed from ATR-FTIR. Although both the blends were found to be decomposed within a period of two weeks, the releasing efficiencies significantly affected the growth of maize seedlings. According to the growthability based on count and greenness of leaves, shoot and root biomasses and phytotoxicity of fertilizers, the TPS/ENR with 80 phr of fertilizer represented the suitable one for growing the seedlings with proper release ability of fertilizer, especially the N, P and K elements during planting. Relating the water swelling of 180 %, it was found that the approximately 90 % of N, 70 % of P and 95 % of K were released before the complete decomposition degradation. This newly controlled release fertilizer (CRF) system can be applied for several plants by knowing the fertilizer concentration and ease of shape designing."
811;"Estimation of the effectiveness of multi-criteria decision analysis and machine learning approaches for agricultural land capability in Gangarampur Subdivision, Eastern India";"Estimation of the effectiveness of multi-criteria decision analysis and machine learning approaches for agricultural land capability in Gangarampur Subdivision, Eastern India";"Land suitability analysis (LSA) is an evaluation method that measures the degree to which land is suitable for certain land use. The primary aims of this study are to identify potentially viable agricultural land in the Gangarampur subdivision (West Bengal) using Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and machine learning procedures and to evaluate the efficacy of the employed methodologies. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model was used to assign relative weights to the fifteen various criteria in this suitability analysis, and then the Fuzzy Complex Proportional Assessment (FCOPRAS) model was applied using the AHP?s normalised pairwise comparison matrix, whereas the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka) Software was used to apply machine learning algorithms to the field data. The Random Forest (RF) model, on the other hand, is a better fit for the locational study of soil potential. According to the RF findings, areas of 14.67 per cent (15368.46 ha) are excellent (ZONE V) for growing crops, approximately 22.30 per cent (23367.9 ha) are highly suitable (ZONE IV), and 23.63 per cent (24762.12 ha) are moderately suitable (ZONE III) for cultivation, respectively. The numbers for FCOPRAS are roughly 15.39% (16130.52 ha), 22.54% (23620.65 ha), and 19.79% (20733.26 ha). The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and accuracy measurements of the results indicate the high accuracy of the applied models, with Random Forest and FCOPRAS being the most popular and effective techniques. This study will make an important contribution to evaluations of soil fertility and site suitability. This will help local government officials, academics, and farmers scientifically use the land."
812;Modelling stakeholder perceptions to assess Green Infrastructures potential in agriculture through fuzzy logic: A tool for participatory governance;"Emma Schiavon a,* , Andrea Taramelli a,b , Antonella Tornato b a";"Solutions like Green Infrastructures can restore and maintain key regulative ecosystem services capable of mitigating disaster risk and contributing to climate change adaptation. Given the vulnerabilities that affect agriculture and its role in national economies, GI can play an important role in managing trade-offs between conflicting ecosystem services. However, their use is still lagging behind, and socio-economic dynamics in their uptake in the agricultural sector are partially disregarded. The uncertainty involved in the modelling of ecological processes can be reduced through the use of participatory processes and the involvement of relevant stakeholders to sustain decision-making processes. This article intends to assess stakeholders? perceptions on the implementation of Green Infrastructures in agriculture by capturing critical barriers and facilitators. The implementation of such Green Infrastructures policies is associated to different climate change trends in order to understand the effect of different scenarios on rural development. The study uses fuzzy logic to elicit the stakeholders? needs. The key results show that when there is uncertainty in the state of climate change trends, it is always more efficient to adopt progressive policies investing in the development and diffusion of Green Infrastructures."

Hasanov a , Goblan J. Algahtani c , Frank A. Felder a";"The Saudi agricultural sector relies on diesel for irrigation that is provided to farmers at a price much lower than the average global price, implying significant opportunity costs. By soft-coupling power and macroeconometric models, we assessed cost and economic (macro and sectoral) implications of electrifying irrigation activities in the Saudi agricultural sector via three scenarios: electrifying each individual farm with a dedicated hybrid renewable micro-grid, electrifying the entire farm cluster with central generation, and connecting the entire cluster to the national grid. Compared with the base-case, connecting the farm cluster to the national grid was the most economic but least environmentally friendly. The renewable and central generation scenarios were costlier due to high battery costs and gas infrastructure needed, respectively. Further, the financial viability of the renewable microgrid option depends on the opportunity cost assumption. From an economic (macro and sectoral) perspective, we found that: (i) job and value-added creation effects of saved-diesel spending from export revenues is positive, but quite small implying the more diesel displaced the more benefits realized, (ii) sectoralspecific spending is more growth- and employment-enhancing than general-spending of the government suggesting taking measures to further enhance the efficiency of governmental spending as highlighted in the Fiscal Sustainability Program."
814;Exploring the nexus between agriculture and greenhouse gas emissions in BIMSTEC region: The role of renewable energy and human capital as moderators;"Gagan Deep Sharma a , Muhammad Ibrahim Shah b , Umer Shahzad c,* , Mansi Jain a , Ritika Chopra a";"Agriculture and the food system emit a considerable amount of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. Hence, current researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders are calling for improving the environmental performance of agriculture. This study utilizes the countries of The Bay of Bengal Initiative for MultiSectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) to investigate the effect of agriculture value-added, pesticide use, renewable energy adoption, human capital, and economic growth on greenhouse gas emissions. The moderation effect of renewable energy use and human capital is also introduced to see whether they can offset agriculture?s emissions in these BIMSTEC economies. Having reported a state-of-the-art literature review, the econometric procedure applies the second-generation unit root tests, panel cointegration and panel quantile regression for three preferred model specifications. The result from the Panel quantile regression method reveals a U-shaped relationship between agriculture value-added and greenhouse gas emissions, suggesting the significance of a small farming system. Human capital has a negative effect, whereas pesticide use has a positive effect on greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the moderation effect of human capital and pesticide use suggests that human capital is not significant enough to offset the effect of pesticide use on the greenhouse gas emissions, whereas the interaction of renewable and pesticide use suggests that renewable energy adoption in the agriculture sector can mitigate the effect of pesticide use on GHG emissions. Finally, the conclusions of the study support the achievement of few sustainable development goals."

In this sense, some technologies are used to overcome this bottleneck. The present study sought to investigate the insertion of cisterns and public irrigation schemes in seven sub-basins in Brazil?s semi-arid regions, to verify their effects on family farming agricultural development and their suitability according to water availability trend. These technologies were spatialized and agricultural production trend lines, between 1995 and 2017, were generated in order to indicate these technologies efficiency. Finally, the precipitation, surface and subsurface runoff trend was evaluated for all sub-basins. Trend analysis in agricultural production showed that a large part of the municipalities had a decrease in agricultural production and municipalities that had a larger number of cisterns did not achieve good agricultural development, while agricultural irrigation systems brought better results. Regarding physical-natural conditions, subsurface runoff has decreased and an increase in surface runoff was identified, which can be collected through the installation of new cisterns. However, for this purpose, future investigations are important to identify the factors that are affecting cisterns performance."

It consists of the updated version of the dataset published by Grosse et al., (2020) but is extended by further LTE metadata, categories and research themes. Each set of metadata consists of up to 49 different attributes (categorical or numeric). Collected attributes were analyzed according to several research themes, including fertilization, crop rotation and tillage treatments. The collection of individual metadata was enlarged by the recent agreement between the BonaRes (www.bonares.de) and EJP SOIL (www.ejpsoil.eu) groups into the most comprehensive dataset in Europe, providing access to LTE and other, shorter running experiments. This dataset centralized past and existing information usually dispersed across several national actors. As such, it provides an extensive database that can be used by decision-makers, scientists, LTE owners and the public. The dataset can be updated in the future to foster networking and information exchange continuously."

Considering small-scale farming in the cereal-legume systems of Eastern and Southern Africa, we introduce a conceptual framework and apply an econometric model using data from a sample of 2208 households to assess factors limiting technology diffusion. Results show that investment-ready and food-secure small producers are more willing to adopt agricultural technology options, increased access to financial services is needed to enhance farm households? value-chain readiness and policy interventions promoting pluralistic extension service expansion and enhancing access to stable input and output markets are an incentive to adopt. The results from the cross-country comparison have shown that the examined factors have a similar influence on the extent of farm households? adoption of the proposed agricultural innovations. However, the heterogeneous nature of the smallholder farming environment in Eastern and Southern Africa implies that promotions of sustainable agricultural systems should be based on technology packages adapted to the complexity and diversity of smallholders? farming systems."

Such technologies include several in-field and remote sensors besides data processing software packages. The accumulation of archived data from season to season has become an issue considering the high spatial and temporal resolution of the generated data from the commercially available sensors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify the accumulated data considering the evolution of utilized digital solutions from a farmer?s case study. This study estimated the data storage disc space requirements in the last two decades from a 22 ha field located in North Italy. The farmer?s accumulated data sources were from an in-field weather station, soil analysis information, soil apparent electrical conductivity scanning, soil moisture sensor, planter performance monitoring system, yield maps, Sentinel-2 satellite images, and recently drone images. The accumulated data were reported on an annual basis with respect to each year?s specific contribution. The results showed that the total accumulated data size from the study field reached 18.6 GB in 2020 mainly due to the use of drone images with a predicted total data size of 40.5 GB by 2025."

The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission providing a systematic 5-day revisit cycle and free data access opens a completely new avenue for near real-time crop specific monitoring at parcel level over large countries. This research investigated the feasibility to propose methods and to develop an open source system able to generate, at national scale, cloud-free composites, dynamic cropland masks, crop type maps and vegetation status indicators suitable for most cropping systems. The so-called Sen2-Agri system automatically ingests and processes Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time series in a seamless way to derive these four products, thanks to streamlined processes based on machine learning algorithms and quality controlled in situ data. It embeds a set of key principles proposed to address the new challenges arising from countrywide 10 m resolution agriculture monitoring. The full-scale demonstration of this system for three entire countries (Ukraine, Mali, South Africa) and five local sites distributed across the world was a major challenge met successfully despite the availability of only one Sentinel-2 satellite in orbit. In situ data were collected for calibration and validation in a timely manner allowing the production of the four Sen2-Agri products over all the demonstration sites. The independent validation of the monthly cropland masks provided for most sites overall accuracy values higher than 90%, and already higher than 80% as early as the mid-season. The crop type maps depicting the 5 main crops for the considered study sites were also successfully validated: overall accuracy values higher than 80% and F1 Scores of the different crop type classes were most often higher than 0.65. These respective results pave the way for countrywide crop specific monitoring system at parcel level bridging the gap between parcel visits and national scale assessment. These full-scale demonstration results clearly highlight the operational agriculture monitoring capacity of the Sen2-Agri system to exploit in near realtime the observation acquired by the Sentinel-2 mission over very large areas. Scaling this open source system on cloud computing infrastructure becomes instrumental to support market transparency while building national monitoring capacity as requested by the AMIS and GEOGLAM G-20 initiatives."
820;The effect of agricultural total factor productivity on environmental degradation in sub-Saharan Africa;Hamdiyah Alhassan;"The debates on the effect of agricultural productivity on environmental quality have received great importance from researchers and policymakers. On one hand, agricultural productivity is considered to promote economic growth and environmental quality, and on the other hand, increase profitability through higher agricultural productivity encourages cropland expansion which causes deforestation and degrades the environment. In view of the foregoing, this study attempts to examine the effect of agricultural total factor productivity on carbon dioxide emissions using a panel of 38 sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries over the period 1981?2016. The outcome from the Fully Modified Ordinal Least Square and Canonical Cointegration Regression models reveal that the link between agricultural total factor productivity and carbon dioxide emissions in SSA shows a U-shaped relationship. This implies that agricultural productivity initially reduces carbon dioxide emissions to a certain point, beyond which higher agricultural productivity increases carbon dioxide emissions, contradicting the Borlaug hypothesis. Likewise, income has a U-shaped relationship with carbon dioxide emissions, implying that the Environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis does not hold for SSA. Further findings show that urbanization and trade openness increase carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, policies that improve environmental outcomes in the agricultural sector should be promoted."
821;Quantitative analysis of agricultural drought propagation process in the Yangtze River Basin by using cross wavelet analysis and spatial autocorrelation;"Ronghui Lia , Nengcheng Chena,b , Xiang Zhanga,c,? , Linglin Zengd , Xiaoping Wangc , Shengjun Tange , Deren Lia,b , Dev Niyogif,g";"It is important to understand the propagation of an agricultural drought, which is crucial for early warning. Recent studies have partly revealed this hidden process and regarded it as another critical feature of drought, but the relevant studies are still limited. Here, we propose a quantitative method to explore the full propagation process of agricultural drought by using cross-wavelets combined with multiple drought indices and spatial autocorrelation methods. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Runoff Index (SRI), Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI) and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) were adopted to characterize meteorological, hydrological, soil moisture and vegetation droughts, respectively. The propagation time of agricultural drought was investigated by the cross wavelet analysis. The spatial relationship of those droughts was examined by spatial autocorrelation method. Results demonstrated that the propagation time was within one month from meteorological to hydrological drought, and within two months from hydrological to soil moisture drought, and between two to three months from hydrological to vegetation drought in most areas of Yangtze River Basin, respectively. It was also found the meteorological and hydrological droughts, hydrological and soil moisture droughts, hydrological and vegetation droughts were all characterized by statistical linkages on both long and short time scales. The global Morans Index of SPI, SRI and SSI were higher than 0.7 and the local Morans Index were mainly High-High and Low-Low clustering, indicating those subtype droughts were closely associated with the neighboring regions. This study clearly revealed the full propagation of agricultural drought in Yangtze River Basin both from spatial and temporal perspective for the first time, which provides valuable knowledge for understanding and predicting agricultural drought."
822;Dynamics of deforestation worldwide: A structural decomposition analysis of agricultural land use in South America;"Alberto Franco-Sol? a,c,* , Claudia V. Montan? b";"Deforestation, mainly caused by the conversion of forest land to agriculture, threatens the achievement of multiple goals across the 2030 Agenda. This environmental issue is particularly marked in the area formed by Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay (ABP region), where a net forest loss of more than 5,5 million hectares per year and a simultaneous net gain in agricultural land of almost 3 million hectares were registered during 2000?2015. To identify the main contributors to the growth in agricultural land use driving regional deforestation, a Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA) is applied on multiregional input-output tables. Results suggest that changes detected within ABP were mainly influenced by shifts in domestic demand and exacerbated by the influence of Brazil within the Mercosur trade agreement. Outside ABP, results show that consumption per capita and population expansion in developed and developing economies (the EU28, the US, and China) are major drivers of regional deforestation. Although globalization led to a surge in the ABP?s land displaced to other countries, our results indicate that outsourced agricultural activities did not affect the growth in ABP?s agricultural land use. There is thus a need of designing mitigation measures with a global sense that also addresses co-responsibility mechanisms among countries in the region."
823;Preserving the quality of agricultural products via the photocatalytic decomposition of ethylene in a spiral-type reactor;"Fumihide Shiraishi* , Toshiaki Koto, Yuichi Akimoto";"The photocatalytic decomposition of ethylene in a spiral-type reactor was investigated to develop a method for preserving the quality of agricultural products. Ethylene was injected or discharged from an apple into a 0.016 m3 closed container and was photocatalytically decomposed in the reactor at 25 ?C. The results indicated that ethylene was decomposed and became undetectable (the amount of ethylene was lower than the detection limit of 40 ppb), which is useful for preserving the quality of agricultural products over long periods of time. For the demonstration experiment, we placed an apple, a persimmon, a cucumber, a cabos (Citrus sphaerocarpa), and a banana in a 0.117 m3 closed container at 25 ?C. When the air inside the container was not photocatalytically treated, the concentration of ethylene increased up to 2.7 ppm. This lowered the quality of the persimmon, cucumber, and apple significantly. In contrast, when the air inside the container was photocatalytically treated, they remained fresh for at least nine days. Methane was simultaneously generated as a byproduct. It was hypothesized that methane was the product of the photocatalytic decomposition of some unknown chemical compound released from the analyzed agricultural products however, we were unable to identify the chemical compound. Computer simulations using experimentally determined parameter values suggested that the decomposition of ethylene begins before or as soon as agricultural products are stored in closed rooms, such as truck containers. In conclusion, the photocatalytic decomposition of ethylene using a spiral-type reactor is effective for preserving the quality of agricultural products."
824;Using spectral indices and terrain attribute datasets and their combination in the prediction of cadmium content in agricultural soil;"Prince Chapman Agyeman * , Vahid Khosravi , Ndiye Michael Kebonye , Kingsley John , Lubo?s Boruvka , Radim Va?sat";"The continuous demand placed on farmland to yield optimal harvest is dependent on the continuous application of agrochemicals and fertilizers to increase soil fertility and manage diseases. Successive application of fertilizers and use of agrochemicals coupled with metal and steel industries introduce potentially toxic elements into the soil. Active agricultural activities and industrial emissions that result in atmospheric cadmium (Cd) injection and active deposition on agricultural soil (particularly from the primary metal industry, steel and iron industrial production). The concentration of cadmium in the study area exceeds the local background value. As a result, excessive cadmium soil concentration will contribute to increased toxic and carcinogenic effects, with negative implications for both environmental and human health. Therefore, determining the spatial distribution of Cd is critical for environmentally friendly agricultural production and reducing Cd emission into soils. The goals of this study are to (i) determine the variability of Cd prediction in agricultural soil using spectral indices or terrain attributes coupled with modeling algorithms, and (ii) determine whether combining spectral indices and terrain attributes coupled with modeling algorithms can improve Cd prediction efficiency in agricultural soil. The study applied three modelling scenarios, comprised prediction using terrain attributes coupled with digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches (Scenario 1), prediction using spectral indices combined with DSMs (Scenario 2), and prediction using a combination of terrain attributes, spectral indices, and DSMs (Scenario 3). Gaussian process regression (GPR), partial least square regression (PLSR), extreme gradient boosting (EGB), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Bayesian regularized neural network (BRNN), regularized random forest (RRF), Bayesian generalized linear model (BGLM), and M5 tree models were the DSMs used in the study. The M5 tree model and terrain attributes {Scenario 1 R2 = 0.77, concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) = 0.73, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.45, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.37 and median absolute error (MdAE) = 0.35}, EGB and spectral indices {Scenario 2, R2 = 0.83, CCC = 0.76, RMSE = 0.54, MAE = 0.33 and MdAE = 0.23} and the M5 tree model, spectral indices and terrain attributes {Scenario 3, R2 = 0.84, CCC = 0.81, RMSE = 0.39, MAE = 0.31 and MdAE = 0.24} were the overall best combinations that predicted Cd in the agricultural soil. The overall evaluation of the approaches suggested that the combination of spectral indices, terrain attributes, and the M5 tree model in Scenario 3 was the optimal technique for predicting Cd in agricultural soil. Thus, a combination of environmental covariates with a high correlation with the response variable, combined with appropriate modeling techniques predicting potentially toxic elements in agricultural soil, will produce the best results."
825;Breakpoint detection in non-stationary runoff time series under uncertainty;"Niloofar Farsi, Najmeh Mahjouri? , Hamid Ghasemi";"Most conventional hydrological time series models, used for forecasting or synthetic data generation, are based on the stationary hypothesis. Hydrologic variables such as surface runoff discharge exhibit non-stationary behavior due to the effects of climate change or human activities. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to analyze the uncertainty of the number and location of breakpoints in runoff time series. The non-stationary runoff time series is simulated by segmenting the series into stationary pieces, which follow an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) process, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The length of each piece and the order of the piecewise ARMA model are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Several runoff time series with variable lengths are generated based on the observed data and the probability distribution function(s) (PDFs) of breakpoint location(s) are constructed. An optimal set of breakpoint locations are found for each generated runoff time series by minimizing the objective function based on the MDL. Finally, the PDF(s) of breakpoint location(s) is (are) constructed using the results of the mentioned optimization model. To evaluate the proposed methodology, it is applied to the case study of Zayandehrud River in Iran. According to the obtained breakpoint PDF for the runoff time series, three breakpoints around years of 1987, 1996 and 2006 are identified. The results are analyzed by investigating the time series of agricultural lands derived using remote sensing data and studying the impacts of interbasin water transfer projects implemented in the study area. Overall, investigating human-induced changes in the study area confirms the obtained shape of the PDF of runoff breakpoint and shows the good performance of the developed method for finding the number and location of breakpoints in the runoff time series."
826;"Linkages between forest growth, climate, and agricultural production are revealed through analysis of seasonally-partitioned longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) tree rings";"Michael C. Stambaugh a, *, Seth W. Bigelow b , Erin R. Abadir a";"We established a five-century long tree-ring chronology partitioned between earlywood and latewood growth to examine intra-annual climate response and attempt to establish linkages to agricultural production. Longleaf pine earlywood and latewood width chronologies spanned the period 1491?2017 (527 years) and constitute one of the longest records achieved for this species. High monthly correlations were found between latewood growth and summer-fall Palmer Drought Z-Index. Correlations were consistently significantly positive for June through October. Intra-annual growth of earlywood and latewood were positively correlated for the full period of record, but exhibited variability in correlation strength through time. Conversely, earlywood and prior-year latewood were also frequently correlated, but correlations were found to switch between positive and negative association, possibly in response to Atlantic Ocean temperatures. Annual yields of major crops are coupled with latewood growth, representing a new and potentially valuable proxy for linking agricultural yields to climate proxies over multiple centuries."
827;Monitoring environmental and climate goals for European agriculture: User perspectives on the optimization of the Copernicus evolution offer;"Emma Schiavon a,* , Andrea Taramelli a,b , Antonella Tornato b , Fabio Pierangeli c";"A vicious cycle exists between agricultural production and climate change, where agriculture is both a driver and a victim of the changing climate. While new and ambitious environmental and climate change-oriented goals are being introduced in Europe, the monitoring of these objectives is often jeopardized by a lack of technological means and a reliance on heavy administrative procedures. In particular, remote sensing technologies have the potential to significantly improve the monitoring of such goals but the characteristics of such missions should take into consideration the needs of users to guarantee return on investments and effective policy implementation. This study aims at identifying gaps in the current offer of Copernicus products for the monitoring of the agricultural sector through the elicitation of stakeholder requirements. The methodology is applied to the case study of Italy while the approach is scalable at European level. The elicitation process associates user needs to the European and national legislative framework to create a policy-oriented demand of Copernicus Earth Observation services. Results show the limitations faced by environmental managers in relation to the use of Remote Sensing technologies and the shortcomings associated with a purely technology driven approach to the development of satellite missions. Through the introduction of this flexible and user centred approach instead, this paper provides a clear overview of agro-environmental user requirements and represents the basis for the definition of an integrated agricultural service."
828;Multifunctionality can be promoted by increasing agriculture-dominated heterogeneous landscapes in an agro-forestry interlacing zone in northeast China;"Yujie Guo a,c , Zhibin Ren a,c , Yulin Dong b,c , Peng Zhang a,c , Chengcong Wang a,c , Zijun Ma a,c , Xingyuan He a,c,";"The assessment of landscape multifunctionality is critical for making informed decisions about landscape resource allocation, optimization, and planning. However, accurately estimating multifunctionality has been a challenging issue, and whether heterogeneous landscapes can promote multifunctionality is still unclear. In our study, we developed a comprehensive computational framework for assessing landscape multifunctionality in agro-forestry interlacing zones. Our study considered both the quality and quantity of multifunctionality by using an improved incremental thresholds method. Compared to homogeneous landscapes, heterogeneous landscapes have greater potential to maintain high levels of multifunctionality in terms of both quality and quantity. Moreover, we have conducted an analysis of the peak multifunctionality performance to establish the optimal threshold, with the aim of striking a balance between the quality and quantity of multifunctionality. Specifically, the optimal thresholds for agro-forest landscapes were 60% and 55%, respectively. Our study showed the distinct combinatorial arrangements of functions observed across various thresholds, thereby discerning the potentially dominant function in the landscape. The potential dominant function of agro-forestry landscapes was carbon sequestration, which could significantly contribute to achieving carbon neutrality goals. These findings are instructive for land managers and policy formulators working to achieve ?win?win? sustainable development."
829;Entrepreneurs of the air: Sprayer drones as mediators of volumetric agriculture;"Francisco Klauser * , Dennis Pauschinger";"The article investigates in empirical detail the air-bound practices, expectations and imaginaries that arise from the development and commercialisation of the first authorised drone system in Europe for the automated application of pesticides, which has been developed and sold and is piloted by a Swiss startup company. Sprayer drones make the air relevant for agricultural practices and processes in novel, inherently functionalised and commercialised ways, such is the article?s basic argument. Thus, the aerial realm is being encountered as an object of pragmatically motivated alliances and competitions, which depend on the agendas and organisational structures of the stakeholders involved. This leads to a critical discussion of the issues surrounding the increasing instrumentalisation of the air for agro-entrepreneurial purposes, and opens up a wider reflection on how agriculture relates to the air and, indeed, on how to develop a properly ?volumetric thinking? in contemporary rural studies."
830;Participation dynamics in multiple-peril agricultural insurance: Insights from India;"Ranjan Kumar Ghosh a,* , Vikram Patil b , Nikita Tank c";"Multiple-peril agricultural insurance, although operational in many developing countries, evokes mixed responses among smallholder farmers. In this context, we analyse the farmer-specific characteristics that are most amenable for participation in India?s revamped federal agricultural insurance program. A sequential logit model is applied to a primary survey-based dataset of 1332 farmers in order to examine the factors influencing various transitions across categories. Age, female as gender and previous insurance experiences turn out to positively influence participation. Engagement in non-farm occupation and higher access to irrigation reduce the likelihood of participation. In the event that the insurance product is delinked from state supported farm credit, the more educated farmers want to move out while female farmers prefer to stay. These results offer important policy insights amidst the persistent efforts to establish a selfsustaining market for agricultural insurance in developing countries."
831;Enhancing climate resilience of irrigated agriculture: A review;Frank A. Ward;"Emerging evidence showing trends in climate change with a strong likelihood those changes will continue elevates the importance of finding affordable adaptations by irrigated agriculture. Successful climate adaptation measures are needed to affordably sustain irrigated agriculture in the face of elevated carbon emissions affecting the reliability of water supplies. Numerous potential adaptation options are available for adjusting irrigated agricultural systems to implement climate risk adaptation. This work focuses on addressing the gap in the literature defined by a scarcity of reviews on measures to elevate the capacity of irrigated agriculture to enhance its climate change resilience. Accordingly, the original contribution of this work is to review the literature describing measures for enhancing climate resilience by irrigated agriculture. In addition, it describes the role of economic analysis to discover affordable measures to enhance resilience by irrigated agriculture. It achieves those aims by posing the question ?What principles, practices, and recent developments are available to guide discovery of measures to improve resilience by irrigated agriculture to adapt to ongoing evidence of climate change?? It addresses that question by reviewing several risk reduction measures to control the economic cost of losses to irrigators in the face of growing water supply unreliability. Following this review, a role for optimizing a portfolio of climate adaptation measures is described, followed by a discussion of potential contributions that can be made by the use of hydroeconomic analysis. Results provide a framework for economic analysis to discover economically attractive methods to elevate resilience of irrigated agriculture."
832;"Geophysical and contamination assessment of soil spatial variability for sustainable precision agriculture in Omu-Aran farm, Northcentral Nigeria";"O.T. Kayode a,* , A.P. Aizebeokhai a , A.M. Odukoya b";"The spatial and temporal variability of soil properties (fluid composition, structure, and water content) and hydrogeological properties employed for sustainable precision agriculture can be obtained from geoelectrical resistivity methods. For sustainable precision agricultural practices, site-specific information is paramount, especially during the planting season. An integrated one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) electrical resistivity survey have been adopted to characterize the subsoil parameters and delineate the aquifer unit of large farm areas, especially in precision agricultural practices. Also, contamination assessment reveals the soil quality status of farmlands. This study aims to determine the site-specific soil parameters of a commercial farm in OmuAran, Northcentral, Nigeria. The subsoil features from the geoelectrical resistivity surveys indicate 3 to 4 distinctive lithology to a depth of 43.4 m into the subsurface of the farm. The ID (Vertical Electrical Sounding) and 2D resistivity inversion models results have revealed the heterogeneity nature of the topsoil, also known as the stone zone comprising of reworked clayey soil and sandy gravelly soil, the weathered/saprolite zone (gravelly sandy/sandy soil), the fractured basement and the fresh basement rock. Contamination factor (Cf), pollution load index (PLI) and Nemerow integrated pollution index (NIPI) were used to assess the contamination index on the farmland. Toxic elements such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, nickel, and zinc have low to moderate contamination in the farm. The depth of investigation (3m) covers the upper root zone of significant crops grown in the area. The findings can assess soil contamination, delineate basement features, subsoil variability, soil profiling, and determine the subsoil hydrological properties."
833;"Not only hedgerows, but also flower fields can enhance bat activity in intensively used agricultural landscapes";"Celina Herrera Kringsa, *, Kevin Darrasa,b , Annika Hassa,c , Peter Batarya,d , Yvonne Fabiana,e";"Agri-environment schemes (AES) have become important tools for farmland biodiversity conservation, providing suitable habitats, resources, and connectivity within the agricultural landscapes. Bats are rarely studied in relation to AES effectiveness in contrast to birds, even though their presence and activity as biological control agents on insects, especially pest species, can be important for agricultural crops. While the role of hedgerows for bat occurrence and activity, as well as for their preys diversity and abundance has been widely studied, the role of other AESs such as flower fields remains unclear. We monitored the activity of the main functional groups (edge, narrow and open space foragers) using ultrasound recorders, as well as potential prey abundances using light traps, across 35 study sites representing different AES in Central Germany from late July to September 2018. The sampled AES consisted of annual flower fields, mixed flower fields (with annual and biennial vegetation), perennial flower fields (sown every 5 years), hedgerows (surrounded by meadows and agricultural fields), and were compared to winter wheat (control) in a balanced design. Bat activity over hedgerows increased threefold for edge space foragers and sevenfold for narrow space foragers compared to wheat fields. Compared to wheat fields, narrow space forager activity increased fourfold over perennial flower fields, threefold over annual and twofold over mixed flower fields. This groups activity over hedgerows also increased almost threefold compared to mixed flower fields. However, the number of feeding buzzes and prey abundance did not differ significantly between AES. We detected foraging group-specific differences in bat activity between the studied AES. Thus, to promote bats in agricultural landscapes and to ensure their biological control services, it is important to establish more AES, such as hedgerows and flower fields, to increase their diversity and connectivity in intensively used agricultural landscapes."
834;Predicting intention in applying solar energy technologies in agriculture industry: A moderated and mediated model;"Amir Rahmani, Ali Bonyadi Naeini *";"Excessive fossil fuel consumption has increased the greenhouse gases (GHG)s effect, and provoked climate change in recent decades. The agricultural industry, one of the major consumers of this energy type, highly contributes to the existing challenges. Applying solar energy technologies (SETs) in this industry can lead to the development of green energies and reduce existing problems. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is adopted to assess the factors influencing farmers? intention to utilize SETs. A researcher-devised questionnaire is distributed among 594 farmers in Tehran Province, Iran, and the obtained data is analyzed through AMOS (version 26) software package. The results revealed the positive and significant effects of attitude, awareness, self-efficacy, trust in technology, performance expectancy, and facilitating conditions on usage intention thus, 57.4% predicted usage intention of SETs. The distance from the power grids (DPG)s moderates the correlation between 1) trust in technology and usage intention,2) the correlation between attitude and usage intention, and 3) facilitating conditions and trust in technology. Attitude partially mediated the correlation between variables (except self-efficacy) and usage intention. In addition to the theoretical implications, this study can assist the policymakers in defining policies for developing renewable energies (RE)s, especially solar, in developing countries."

The corncob biomass (CCB) was pyrolyzed at 700 C for 2hrs (heating rate: 10 C/min) using the in-house built heating chamber in a muffle furnace, eliminating the necessity of pyrolytic chamber. The prepared corncob biochar (CCBC) was characterized for elemental composition, crystallinity (XRD), functional groups (ATR-FTIR), surface morphology-elemental composition (SEM-EDX), surface area (BET), surface charge (point of zero charge), particle size-stability (DLS-zeta potential) and thermal stability (STA). Adsorption efficacy of CCBC was investigated in batch experiment with MB dye as well as effect of various factors such as contact time (5?120 min), initial MB concentration (7?15 mg/L), pH (2?10) and adsorbent dosage (10? 35 mg). Without any chemical treatment for activation, CCBC produced maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax) of 20.42mgg1 at 25 C. The adsorption behavior of MB by CCBC could be better understood by Langmuir isotherm and Pseudo-second order kinetic model as they were the best fitted isotherm and kinetic models. Thus, waste to treat waste, meaning agricultural wastes like corncob can easily be converted into effective adsorbent for treating dye bearing wastewater."
836;Variability and drivers of grassland sensitivity to drought at different timescales using satellite image time series;"Donald A. Luna, Julien Pottier * , Catherine Picon-Cochard";"Drought is expected to increase in frequency and severity with climate change, leading to more intense impacts on grasslands and their associated ecosystem services. Complementary to ground experiments, remote sensing technologies allow for the study of drought impacts with large spatio-temporal coverage in real-life-conditions. We aimed to quantify the variability of grassland sensitivity to drought using a long-term satellite image time series of 394 temperate permanent grassland plots to identify factors influencing these sensitivities. Accordingly, we assessed the slope of the linear relationship between satellite-based vegetation status, using the standardized anomalies of the vegetation indices (VIs), and drought severity, using a modified version of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), from 1985 to 2019. The process was repeated for 24 VIs and five SPEI timescales. We then conducted a linear model selection procedure, using the grassland sensitivity derived from the most responsive VIs (i.e., VIs for which anomalies indicated a tighter linear relationship with the modified SPEI), to identify which grassland properties influenced sensitivity to drought. A total of 29 properties, grouped into pedoclimate, agricultural management, and vegetation diversity factors, were derived from ground measurements. Overall, we demonstrated that the influence of predictors on grassland sensitivity to drought varied across the drought integration timescales. Our results highlighted the significant mitigating effect of soil water holding capacity on sensitivity to drought for short timescales of fewer than 30 days. The date of first herbage use by farmers was positively related to grassland sensitivity to drought across all timescales. We also demonstrated that higher vegetation diversity significantly reduced sensitivity to drought. However, for the long timescales of drought integration, such influence was mainly redundant with management (i.e., shared partition of variance) suggesting complex cascading effects between agricultural practices and plant community structure that still need to be addressed comprehensively in future studies"

Walker a";"Geospatial analysis using remote sensing data has emerged as an effective tool to monitor irrigated lands over a variety of climatic conditions and locations. Humid and heterogeneous landscapes such as those in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain are challenging for satellite image classification over large spatial extents. The objectives of this study are to: 1) compile relevant vegetation indices for mapping and quantifying irrigated and dryland agricultural areas across the coastal plain region of South Carolina, USA 2) identify the spatial and temporal change of the agricultural irrigation areas in the region over time 3) compare the results to county-level statistics reported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the study area. In this study, a framework has been developed to regularly monitor irrigated agriculture?s extent and distribution using high-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery for the coastal plain of South Carolina region using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The maps were produced using random forest supervised classification for three years with overall accuracy assessments of 83.73% (2016), 86.18% (2017), and 84.55% (2018). The major irrigated crops in the study area are corn, cotton, soybeans, and peanuts. Overall, the irrigated crops? distribution areas were mainly concentrated in counties near the center of the studied region. The produced maps will provide valuable information for the development of irrigated agriculture and the optimization of irrigation water use in the region. The methodology followed in this study can be applied to any other regions around the world with similar landscapes and climatic conditions."
838;Objective evaluation of gearshift process of agricultural tractors;"Michele Mattetti, Enrico Michielan, Giacomo Mantovani, Massimiliano Varani";"In the last 20 years, manufacturers have invested in continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) for agricultural tractors, since farmers have demanded more easy-to-use transmissions to increase comfort and driveability. Recently, stepped transmissions have been of interest due to their greater efficiency compared to continuously variable transmissions. To fully compete with CVTs, stepped transmissions must be fully automated and properly handle the operators comfort during gearshifts. This paper aims to define a test procedure and data analysis method for evaluating the gearshift quality of transmissions for agricultural tractors. The procedure is composed of two tests and aims to reproduce the typical manoeuvres that occur during farming, such as accelerating and shuttling. This method was applied to 14 tractors with different transmissions and engine peak power. On each tractor, an inertial measuring unit and a CAN-Logger were installed to record vehicle and powertrain operating conditions. From the recorded data, a set of metrics was calculated to objectively quantify the impact of gearshift. These metrics were combined to obtain an overall score, which allows for the ranking of tractors in terms of gearshift quality and its dependence on design parameters. Based on our metrics, CVTs outperform stepped transmissions due to their ability to combine high performance with comfort measures. The approach outlined in this study enables manufacturers to quickly spot the weak points of the gearshift behaviour of a tractor so that they can address specific issues and increase operator satisfaction and the overall quality of their tractors"
839;Dynamics of subsurface soil erosion in a semiarid region: A time-series study of sinkhole area and morphology;"Osher Rafaeli a,* , Ariel Nahlieli a , Tal Svoray a,b";"Subsurface soil erosion causes irreversible damage to agricultural fields by generating elongated pipes and elliptical sinkholes that can further develop into rills and gullies. However, despite their severe consequences, there is still limited available quantitative information on spatiotemporal dynamics of soil pipes and sinkholes, especially in semiarid regions evidence of subsurface erosion rates is based on a small number of time points during a sampling period that is usually limited to a few successive years. Here, temporal changes in sinkhole area, and their level of circularity and orientation were quantified over a decade (2010?2020), in loess-derived soils in the semiarid Negev desert, Israel. Data were measured using high-resolution aerial photographs (1 pixel = 15 cm length), and were related to high-temporal-resolution rainfall data. The results revealed that: (1) soil pipe collapse is related to early winter rainfall events more than to mid or end-of-winter events, possibly due to the development of annual herbaceous vegetation that shields the soil and increases its resistance to erosion (2) sinkhole and soil pipe morphological development and orientation are related to the orientation of stream banks and the tension cracks developed along those banks and (3) changes in sinkhole area are related to catastrophic rainfall events and not to gradually accumulated annual rainfall."
840;How energy consumption is related to agricultural growth and export: An econometric analysis on Iranian data;"Ahmad Ali Ghaseminejad Raeeni a , Safdar Hosseini b,* , Reza Moghaddasi a";"Iranian agriculture has been supported by cheap energy for decades. So the question of whether this policy had brought any real outcome in terms of sector growth and export is of high importance for policy making. This paper tries to empirically identify such relation by using time series econometrics techniques including causality and cointegration tests for the period 1967?2015. Main results confirm existence of a unidirectional causality from energy consumption to agricultural growth while no relation is found between energy consumption and export. Other findings revealed that one percent increase in energy use results in 1.29 percent rise in agricultural growth in the long-run. In order to avoid detrimental impacts on sector growth, gradual liberalization of energy price for agricultural uses is recommended."

Sandra Schilloe,f , Vivian M. Nguyenc,g";"The magnitude of environmental challenges we are facing today requires the involvement of a diversity of stakeholders and collaborators to develop socially, culturally, and economically robust sustainability practices. Living labs catalyse the development of user-centric solutions for complex environmental issues by exploring, cocreating, testing, and evaluating innovations within real-world contexts. The living lab approach is relatively new in the environmental and agricultural sectors but is quite well established in many areas such as information and communication technology. For living labs to play a greater role in environmental sustainability, we present a research agenda related to the evaluation and effectiveness of living labs in the context of environmental and agricultural sustainability. We refer to evaluation as the act of assessing the process and outcomes of a living lab, and effectiveness as the level to which a living lab is successful in achieving a certain desirable process or outcome. Our research agenda is based on empirical research using an adapted Delphi method ? a process to iteratively gather input from a panel of experts ? involving a total of 44 researchers and experts in the domains of living labs, evaluation methods, and agro-environmental issues. The resulting integrated research agenda identifies important gaps in both research and practice to improve the impact of living labs. Our findings highlight the need to better understand effective use of this collaborative, open innovation approach in research and management focused on environmental and agricultural sustainability. Future research should investigate the knowledge gaps for we have identified in terms of diversity of stakeholders, key dimensions of evaluation and how to enable effectiveness of living labs."

These unprecedented challenges urge the adoption of novel and resource-efficient strategies to close yield gaps. Foliar fertilization has been well recognized for two decades to affect crop productivity, however, the consequences of foliar spray under multiple environmental stresses remains elusive, albeit evidence to resilience agriculture has grown widely. Here, we provide a focused overview of recent developments unravelling the significance of foliar nutrition under multifaceted agricultural production scenario(s). The mechanisms involved in the absorption and translocation of foliar-applied minerals are critically discussed to highlight their efficiency and effectiveness. The potential of foliar fertilization in improving crop yield and quality under environmental stresses has been evaluated based on a meta-analysis. Foliar-applied fertilizers showed higher crop plants yield and quality traits by 15?19% and 9?29%, respectively, under different environmental stresses. The knowledge gaps to improve the effectiveness of foliar nutrition from economic and ecological perspectives has been discussed. This comprehensive review draws attention to the potential of foliar fertilization to close yield gaps and endure agriculture sustainability, particularly under hostile soils and deteriorating environmental conditions."
843;Explaining Growing Glyphosate Use: The Political Economy of Herbicide-Dependent Agriculture;Jennifer Clapp;"The growing use of chemical herbicides for weed control has become a dominant feature of modern industrial agriculture and a major environmental and health concern in agricultural systems worldwide. This paper seeks to explain how and why glyphosate-based agricultural herbicides have become so entrenched in modern agriculture. It shows that a complex interplay among technological, market, and regulatory developments have encouraged a lock-in of glyphosate linked technologies in agricultural systems. These are: (1) the repurposing of glyphosate for use with genetically modified crops (2) the rise of the generic glyphosate market, which globalized the chemical?s use and encouraged new agricultural uses (3) new technologies such as digital agriculture and genome editing that interface with glyphosate use and (4) growing corporate market power and declining public investment in agricultural research programs that constrained innovation in non-herbicide weed control technologies."
844;The spectralrao-monitoring Python package: A RAO?s Q diversity index-based application for land-cover/land-use change detection in multifunctional agricultural areas;"Andrea Tassi a , Andrea Massetti a , Artur Gil b,c,*";"Monitoring multifunctional agricultural areas is paramount to ensure their cost-effective management. The remote sensing-based detection of land-cover/land-use (LCLU) changes and analysis of vegetation dynamics constitute a relevant indicator to support robust monitoring schemes, allowing the control of agri-environmental conditions and enforcing related measures and policies. The Rao?s Q diversity index (RaoQ) is frequently used to measure functional diversity in ecology, thanks to the textural analysis of the environment. This paper aims to develop and provide an open-source Python application whose workflow may constitute a RaoQ-based LCLU change monitoring tool for multifunctional agricultural areas. Here, a use case is presented for detecting and mapping LCLU changes leveraging the free and open access Landsat 8 (L8) satellite data. The workflow is organized in four main stages: (1) data processing (2) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculation (3) RaoQ calculation and (4) detection and mapping of LCLU changes through thresholding of RaoQ. Three methodological approaches were developed (RaoC ? ?classic? RaoQ RaoMD ? ?multidimensional? RaoQ, and ?classic + multidimensional? RaoQ) with overall accuracies ranging from 0.88 to 0.92. An example of an agri-environmental monitoring decision-support framework based on spectralrao-monitoring is presented. The application is easily reproducible, and the code is fully available and utilizable with other sensors at different resolutions to support monitoring other types of agricultural areas."
845;"An actionable hydroeconomic Decision Support System for the assessment of water reallocations in irrigated agriculture. A study of minimum environmental flows in the Douro River Basin, Spain";"C. Dionisio P?erez-Blanco a,* , Laura Gil-Garc? a , Pablo Saiz-Santiago b";"Despite major recent advances in socio-hydrology and hydroeconomics research, interdisciplinary methods and models for water policy assessment remain largely concealed to the academic arena. Most river basin authorities still base decision-making on inputs from hydrologic Decision Support Systems (DSS), and have limited information on the economic costs that water policies may impose on the economy. This paper presents a time-variant hierarchical framework that connects a hydrologic module and an economic module by means of two-way feedback protocols. The hydrologic module is designed to fit the AQUATOOL DSS, the hydrologic model used by Spanish river basin authorities to inform decision-making at a basin scale while the economic module is populated with a Positive Multi-Attribute Mathematical Programming (PMAMP) model that represents the behavior and adaptive responses of irrigators. The proposed hierarchical framework is used to assess the economic repercussions of strengthening irrigation quotas so to achieve minimum environmental flows in the Douro River Basin (Spain) under climate change. Results show that reductions in agricultural water allocations to meet environmental flow requirements create nonlinear incremental profit and employment losses in irrigated agriculture that are on average low to moderate (between - 4% and - 12.9 % for profit, and between - 4.6 % and - 12 % for employment, depending on the scenario). During extreme droughts, the abrupt reductions in water availability and agricultural allocations can test farming systems past the breaking point and lead to catastrophic profit and employment losses (>80 %)."

Towards better understanding of factors controlling bioavailable Si in soils, here we quantified the release rate of Si from several pairs of French forest and agricultural topsoils, developed on calcareous or loess parent material. We used mixed-flow and column reactors, in acetate and carbonate buffers and distilled water, at various pH (4?8) and time of reaction (day to month). The rate of Si release from soil (RSi) exceeded that of crystalline clay minerals by 1?2 orders of magnitude, being 5?10 times lower than that of various allophanes. The rates were weakly dependent on pH (compared to clays or phytoliths) and varied from 5 ? 10- 7 to 2 ? 10- 6 mol/gsoil/day at 4 < pH = 8. In terms of Si reactivity, four studied soil groups followed the order: ?calcaric cambisols ? hypereutric cambisols = luvisols = albeluvisol?. Calcaric and hypereutric cambisols as well as luvisols exhibited a weak decrease of RSi with pH increase. The rate of Si release from albeluvisol increased 2 times with a pH increase from 4 to 8. There was no measurable difference in RSi between agricultural and forest soils. The pool of labile Si in forest soils was quantified via soil column flow-through experiments. The breakthrough curves of Si demonstrated high concentrations (1.6?5.7 mg/L) over first several hours of reaction in the soil column. The water leachable Si pool ranged from 0.04 to 0.08 mg Si gsoil - 1 , corresponding to labile Si stock in the 0?20 cm soil of 80?160 kg ha- 1 . These values can meet the annual requirements of plants in forests and cultivated soils. The pool of labile Si correlated (RPearson > 0.90 p < 0.05) with Si associated with amorphous Fe and Al compounds and soluble bioavailable Si extracted using CaCl2 method, but negatively correlated with total Si content in soils and Si of phytoliths. The main pools of soil labile Si could be allophanes, organo-Fe-Al-Si compounds and adsorbed forms of Si onto Fe and Al hydroxides. We hypothesize that, because of low sensibility of RSi to type of soil and fluid pH, the majority of soils regulate Si release at some ?universal? rate which is further reflected in relatively narrow range of riverine Si concentrations and export fluxes across the world. Therefore, the modeling of chemical weathering and element export flux in the watersheds should incorporate the experimentally measured reactivity of the whole soil rather than individual constituting primary or secondary minerals."
847;Water and pesticide transfers in undisturbed soil columns sampled from a Stagnic Luvisol and a Vermic Umbrisol both cultivated under conventional and conservation agriculture;"Sixtine Cueffa,b,? , Lionel Allettoa , Marjolaine Bourdat-Deschampsb , Pierre Benoitb , Val?ie Potb,?";"The main goals of conservation agriculture are to enhance soil fertility and to reduce soil degradation especially through erosion. However, conservation agriculture practices can exhibit a higher risk of contamination through vertical flows. The objectives of this study were to (i) characterise water and pesticide transfers in two different soils both managed under conventional and conservation agriculture and (ii) assess the effects of pesticide properties, soil type and agricultural system on pesticide fate. We studied the behaviour of two herbicides (nicosulfuron and mesotrione) and a molluscicide (metaldehyde) in percolation experiments in undisturbed soil columns. A series of two rain events (one with a high, the other with a low intensity) separated by a two-day flow interruption was applied three days after the pesticides and bromide application. Batch sorption coefficients, Kd, were also measured. While the Pesticides Properties Data Base (2020) indicated a decrease of sorption in the order mesotrione > metaldehyde > nicosulfuron, the measured Kd, decreased in the order mesotrione (2.3 ? 1.4 L.kg-1) > nicosulfuron (0.7 ? 0.4 L.kg-1) > metaldehyde (0.1 ? 0.1 L.kg-1). We highlighted distinct behaviour of pesticide leaching depending mainly on soil type, agricultural practices and pesticide properties. For low degree of preferential flow, pesticide leaching can be related to the sorption properties of pesticides. Nicosulfuron and mesotrione delays are more pronounced under conservation management while metaldehyde always arrived with no delay. During the high intensity rain event, on one soil type, high degree of preferential flow masked sorption effect on leaching since every pesticide arrived at the same time as the tracer and amounted to up to 21% of pesticide recovery compared to 4% on the other soil type. Conservation agriculture was found to improve the vertical transfers of water and pesticides while, on one of the studied soil type, the presence of a low conductive plough pan significantly limits water drainage."
848;Examining the spatial simulation and land-use reorganisation mechanism of agricultural suburban settlements using a cellular-automata and agent-based model: Six settlements in China;"Xue Jiang a,b,1 , Bingxin Li a,b,* , Hongyu Zhao a,b , Qiqi Zhang a , Xiaoya Song c , Haoran Zhang d,e";"Peri-urban land-use development is an important representation of urban-rural system evolution in developing countries. As the modern agriculture industry promotes rapid spatial pattern changes, modelling this phenomenon is of considerable interest to urban planners and city managers. Several methods have been developed to simulate the dynamics of land-use changes. However, the complexity of such dynamics can impede the usefulness of simulation methods. In this paper, a new cellular-automata and agent-based model (CA-ABM) is introduced into the spatial simulation and reorganisation of peri-urban areas. This simulation and predictive model uses the geographic information system platform and cellular automata tool. The basic components of this dynamic bottom-up approach are the actors in land-use development. Using six settlements from plains, hilly, and mountainous areas as examples combined with field investigation, remote sensing images, official land-use planning, and other data, this study analysed land-use evolution under the influence of farmers, developers, and government agents to illustrate the spatial simulation and land-use reorganisation mechanism of agricultural suburban settlements. Compared with previous studies, this study shows that the CA-ABM can reflect the dynamic behaviour of agents and successfully fuses peri-urban settlement attributes and spatially accurate simulation. Simultaneously, the proposed spatial optimisation mechanism provides a reference for the spatial reorganisation of agricultural suburban zones worldwide."
849;Food security outcomes in agricultural systems models: Current status and recommended improvements;"Charles F. Nicholson a,b,* , Emma C. Stephens c , Birgit Kopainsky d , Andrew D. Jones e , David Parsonsf , James Garrett g";"Improvement of food security is a common objective for many agricultural systems analyses, but how food security has been conceptualized and evaluated within agricultural systems has not been systematically evaluated. We reviewed the literature on agricultural systems analyses of food security at the household- and regionallevels, finding that the primary focus is on only one dimension of food security?agricultural output as a proxy for food availability. Given that food security comprises availability, access, utilization and stability dimensions, improved practice would involve more effort to incorporate food access and stability indicators into agricultural systems models. The empirical evidence base for including food access indicators and their determinants within agricultural systems models requires further development through appropriate short and longterm investments in data collection and analysis. Assessment of the stability dimension of food security (through time) is also particularly under-represented in previous work and requires the development and application of appropriate dynamic models of agricultural systems that include food security indicators, coupled with more formalized treatment of robustness and adaptability at both the regional and household levels. We find that agricultural systems models often conflate analysis of food security covariates that have the potential to improve food security (like agricultural yields) with an assessment of food security itself. Agricultural systems modelers should exercise greater caution in referring to analyses of agricultural output and food availability as representing food security more generally."
850;A secure fish farm platform based on blockchain for agriculture data integrity;"Lei Hang, Israr Ullah, Do-Hyeun Kim";"Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up a new dimension for smart farming and agriculture because of the natural feature that makes it possible to assign tasks made by a user or that transfers agriculture data obtained through sensors to producers for analysis on various terminal devices. In recent years, heightened interest in agriculture data has arisen since the commercialization of precision agriculture technology. Agriculture data are known to be messy, especially from combine yield monitors, and analysts are concerned with the validity of data, especially given that other people may have impacted data quality at various steps along the data path. The blockchain can be a possible solution to the analyst?s problem of uncertain data quality from prior data manipulation since it ensures data have not been inappropriately manipulated or at the very least documents what changes have been made by specific individuals. This paper proposes a blockchain-based fish farm platform to ensure agriculture data integrity. The designed platform aims to provide fish farmers with secure storage for preserving the large amounts of agriculture data that cannot be tampered with. Diverse processes of the fish farm are executed automatically by using the smart contract to reduce the risk of error or manipulation. A proof of concept that integrates a legacy fish farm system with the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain is implemented on top of the proposed architecture. The efficiency and usability of the proposed platform are demonstrated through a series of experiments using various metrics."
851;Socioeconomic impact of 2005?2008 drought in Andalusian agriculture;"Jaime Espinosa-Tas? a,b,? , Julio Berbel b , Carlos Guti?rez-Mart? b , Dario Antonino Musolino c,d";"Meteorological drought is defined as the event that arises when precipitation is lower than average and initially affects rainfed crops this is transformed into hydrological drought when persistent drought affects water storage. We have studied the economic impact of multiyear droughts by applying the economic surplus to the last severe drought (2005?2008) in Andalusia. The method is applied to both rainfed and irrigated agriculture. The results show negative effects on regional social welfare, with an estimated global loss of EUR 1512 million, although this negative impact is unequally distributed. There is a quantity effect (lower yields) and higher prices due to shorter supply. Overall, rainfed farms experience a negative impact on their income since higher prices only partially compensate for yield reduction, although, paradoxically, certain irrigation farms increase their income when higher prices overcorrect lower yields. Consumers are always negatively affected by drought. This result may aid in the design of agricultural policy models and drought-recovery policies."
852;"The 2015-19 multi year drought in the Eastern Cape, South Africa: it?s evolution and impacts on agriculture";"Emma Archer a,* , Justin du Toit b , Christien Engelbrecht c , M. Timm Hoffman d , Willem Landman e , Johan Malherbe f , Maryke Stern g,h";"The Eastern Cape Province, and in particular, it?s interior western Karoo region, has long been subject to periodic droughts, with significant implications for it?s agricultural sector. From 2015, with some recovery in 2020, the area experienced a severe multi year drought, with negative impacts for a range of sectors, including extensive livestock farming. At the time of the drought, a common narrative in the media stated that the drought was unprecedented. In this paper, we analyze how the drought evolved climatically, as well as its impacts on vegetation and farming conditions. Our findings indicate that it would appear that the drought was not unprecedented. It was, however, considered to be extremely severe ? with some local impacts found to be critical. Loss of production impacts, and loss of income, now compounded by the difficulties resulting from the COVID19 pandemic (which has impacted the South African economy severely) are likely to continue to impact the agricultural sector in the Eastern Cape for some time ? and given the likelihood of increased frequency of extreme events in southern Africa in the future, we may see more frequent subsequent severe multi-year events."
853;Viewpoint: Aligning vision and reality in publicly funded agricultural research for development: A case study of CGIAR;"Philip Thornton a,* , Jeroen Dijkman b,1 , Mario Herrero c , Lili Szilagyi a , Laura Cramer a,d";"Global food systems are currently facing unprecedented challenges with respect to production and nutritional targets, inclusivity and environmental footprint. Several recent reports highlight the need for major, rapid reconfiguration of our food systems as a result. International publicly funded agricultural research for development will play an increasingly vital role in support of such goals as reducing poverty, improving food and nutrition security, and improving natural resources and ecosystem services. Here we take stock of the work over the last decade of CGIAR, one of the major players in the agricultural research for development arena, from the perspective of published, peer-reviewed science. We do this with respect to several elements of its vision as set out in 2011, elements that are shared by many other organisations that are also working towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, we found a strong association between number of CGIAR publications and countries with large numbers of rural poor and high child stunting prevalence. At the same time several countries were identified that are anomalous, being either relatively over- or under-represented in the peerreviewed literature in relation to numbers of rural poor and stunting prevalence. On average, 30% of the calories consumed in national food baskets come from food sources that are not currently the commodity focus of CGIAR research, such as fruit and vegetables. We identify possible ways in which the alignment between the strategic objectives of an agricultural research for development organisation such as CGIAR and its publicly funded science outputs might be further strengthened, for maximum impact in the nine years that are left for the world to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals."
854;From participatory process to robust decision-making: An Agriculture-water-energy nexus analysis for the Souss-Massa basin in Morocco;"Youssef Almulla a, ?, Camilo Ramirez a , Brian Joyce b , Annette Huber-Lee b , Francesco Fuso-Nerini a";"The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) framework is widely used to address sustainability and resource management questions. However, many WEF methods miss engaging with stakeholders in the process. In this study, we introduce a stakeholder-driven and model-supported robust nexus decision-making framework. This methodology is exemplified by a case study in the Souss-Massa basin (SMB) which has significant importance for the agricultural sector in Morocco. However, the water scarcity exacerbated by climate change, overexploitation of groundwater and heavy use of fossil fuels for pumping is threatening the future of this fertile land. An integrated agriculture, water and energy model was developed to explore various potential solutions or scenarios such as desalination, wastewater reuse and improved water productivity. The analysis revealed that engaging with stakeholders and developing common robust nexus decision metrics is essential to establishing a shared and transparent approach to address the complicated nexus challenges. It also showed that no one solution can address all nexus challenges and highlighted the need for an integrated strategy that stimulates the contributions from different sectors. Finally, the transition from fossil fuel groundwater pumping to solar pumping is shown to be economically and environmentally viable."
855;"Potential ethanol biorefinery sites based on agricultural residues in Alberta, Canada: A GIS approach with feedstock variability";"Yanan Zheng a,b , Claire A. Doll a,c , Feng Qiu a , Jay A. Anderson a,* , Grant Hauer a , M.K. Luckert (Marty)a";"Though numerous studies have investigated optimal locations for biorefineries given the availability of feedstock supplies, few have considered that these supplies could vary over time, thereby potentially failing to meet feedstock requirements. In this paper, we develop a process for identifying a shortlist of five potentially viable biorefinery sites in Alberta, and then consider the stochastic nature of these supplies, and what that variation could mean for supplying a biorefinery. A shortlist of sites was selected based on agricultural residues within a distance of 80 km of the site. Across all sites, a total amount of 16.7 million t [oven dried] y1 is found to be economically accessible in the province. However, this shortlist is based only on a summation of one-year crop yields surrounding the sites. When crop yield variability (estimated from data over 40 years between 1978 and 2017) is also considered, substantially different results were found. For example, if supply was required to exceed 1.59 million t [oven dried] y1 , 95% of the time, then two selected sites, which were chosen based on one-year crop yields, must be excluded. Under these circumstances the total amount available across sites falls to 12.4 million t [oven dried] y1 . Overall, when variability in supply is included as a criterion, site selection and rankings change, suggesting that site selection using only an average or point estimate is not sufficient. Instead, more sophisticated techniques to investigate feedstock supply variability would be useful."
856;A new agricultural drought index for monitoring the water stress of winter wheat;"Dong Wu a,b,c , Zhenhong Li c , Yongchao Zhu d , Xuan Li a , Yingjie Wu a , Shibo Fang a,e";"Timely and effectively monitoring agricultural droughts for winter wheat production is crucial for water resource management, drought mitigation and even national food security. With soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration (ET) products from 2001 to 2018 supplied by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, respectively, two agricultural drought indices, i.e., the univariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index (USMEI) and bivariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index (BSMEI), were developed to reflect water stress for winter wheat. Our case study on the North China Plain (NCP) indicated that the USMEI could effectively monitor agricultural drought, especially in autumn and winter from October to January. Furthermore, compared with the evaporative stress index (ESI) and soil moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI), the correlations between the USMEI and climatic yields were acceptable at the county level or site scale. However, for the rest of the winter wheat growing season, the ESI and SMAPI performed better than the USMEI. In addition, the BSMEI was not suitable for monitoring droughts for winter wheat because this index overestimated the drought intensity."

859;Are agricultural sustainability and resilience complementary notions? Evidence from the North European agriculture;"Artiom Volkov a , Mangirdas Morkunas b , Tomas Balezentis a,b,* , Dalia Streimikiene a";"This study aims to investigate the relationship between sustainability and resilience concepts in agriculture. First, we discuss the theoretical preliminaries related to the definition of these two concepts. Indeed, the literature considers sustainability as a proxy for resilience and vice versa in the context of agriculture. Intuitively, one may expect that sustainability and resilience are positively correlated. Second, we challenge these insights by embarking on empirical analysis directed at the Northern European countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden) that are member states of the European Union. The criteria describing sustainability and economic resilience are identified for the empirical analysis. Third, the criteria decision making is applied to derive the composite indicators. The contemporaneous correlation between the composite indicators of sustainability and economic resilience is rather weak across the analyzed countries. However, the correlation increases in case the first-order differences of the composite indicators are considered. Therefore, economic resilience indicators cannot be replaced by sustainability-related ones and economic resilience should be taken as an additional facet of the economic sustainability when developing composite indicators."
860;Automated delineation of agricultural field boundaries from Sentinel-2 images using recurrent residual U-Net;"Huanxue Zhang a,* , Mingxu Liu b , Yuji Wang a , Jiali Shang c , Xiangliang Liu a , Bin Li a , Aiqi Song d , Qiangzi Li e,";"Delineation of agricultural fields is desirable for operational monitoring of agricultural production and is essential to support food security. Due to large within-class variance of pixel values and small inter-class difference, automated field delineation remains to be a challenging task. In this study, a strategy is proposed to effectively address this issue. Firstly, a framework was developed using the Canny operator connected with the Watershed segmentation algorithm (CW) to quickly label the training dataset, which minimizes the workload of dataset generation in comparison with the commonly used manual vectorization. Secondly, a CW-trained deep semantic segmentation network, recurrent residual U-Net, was selected to mine the low level and deep semantic features. Finally, a boundary connecting method (to integrate fragmented boundaries) was used to generate the agricultural field boundary. The proposed methods are tested over smallholder agricultural landscape in Heilongjiang province, China, using Sentinel-2 imagery. Compared with the U-Net (overall accuracy (OA) 82.18%), the residual U-Net (ResU-Net, with OA 85.78%), traditional object-based image analysis (OBIA, with OA about 82%), and the existing 10-m resolution global land cover map (FROM-GLC10), the proposed method shows an improved performance (OA 89.28%, and Kappa 0.85). The successful application of the proposed method suggests that the recurrent residual U-Net model has great universality in agricultural field boundary extraction, and the automated technique has the potential of being applied to other regions."

862;Geospatial decision support system for ameliorating adverse impacts of irrigated agriculture on aquatic ecosystems;"Christopher M. Fields a,* , John W. Labadie a , Faizal I.W. Rohmat a , Lynn E. Johnson b";"Tributary stream systems provide an important source of water for sustaining adjacent irrigated agricultural enterprises. Unfortunately, irrigation withdrawals, depending on the timing and amounts, can have substantial negative impacts on critical aquatic ecosystems in the tributaries. Current regulatory trends in many regions point to increased restrictions on irrigation diversions for ecosystem protection, which could lead to increased risk of shortfalls in agricultural crop production. A geospatial decision support system (geo-DSS) integrating a spatially gridded hydro-meteorological flow estimation model (HL-RDHM) with a GIS-based river basin management model (GeoMODSIM) is presented for evaluating water management alternatives for maintaining the viability of irrigated agriculture while mollifying detrimental impacts on aquatic ecosystems and maintaining environmental flow requirements. As a case study, the geo-DSS is applied to the Feliz Creek basin tributary to the Russian River of northern coastal California which is home to a thriving viticulture industry while supporting spawning habitat for endangered and threatened fish species. The geo-DSS is applied on spatial (~1 km grid size) and temporal (daily) scales that are ecologically relevant for modeling agricultural operations and water rights priorities. The geo-DSS utilizes extensive sets of hydrologic forcing data varying from dry to wet conditions to assess baseline conditions and evaluate management alternatives. Baseline model results show that with minimum bypass flow restrictions in place for instream flow protection, the cumulative effects of upstream diversions can still be significant during low flow periods, while creating substantial risk of agricultural irrigation supply shortages. The case study application demonstrates that the geo-DSS is capable of locating, sizing, and managing off-stream farm ponds receiving optimally timed diversions from adjacent streams that are necessary for maintaining agricultural water supply while complying with environmental flow requirements for sustaining aquatic ecosystems."

Determining their effects, however, is not as straightforward as it at first seems. The main aim of the study was to determine the driving background factors of a river located in an agricultural watershed, and furthermore, to separate the role of the diffuse- and point source nutrient loads. The method used to achieve the aims was Dynamic Factor Analysis. This is an effective tool for exploring time series which describe such phenomena. It is capable of taking into account the lagged correlation structure, thus enabling the researcher to uncover the background processes operating in time series. Dynamic Factor Analysis was applied to the time series (1978?2006) of 21 response parameters measured in the River Zala and 6 explanatory (agricultural, meteorological, water quality, etc.) parameters measured in its watershed. The results demonstrated that with the aid of Dynamic Factor Analysis the superimposed effects of the socio-economic changes which began in the mid-1980s, and the introduction of advanced wastewater treatment (P removal) in the river catchment in the early 1990s could be separated and their relative importance assessed, as well as that of other determining external factors."
865;Crop type mapping using time-series Sentinel-2 imagery and U-Net in early growth periods in the Hetao irrigation district in China;"Guang Li a , Jiawei Cui b , Wenting Han a,c,* , Huihui Zhang d , Shenjin Huang a , Haipeng Chen a , Jianyi Ao a";"The information on spatial distribution pattern and area of different crops is particularly useful for monitoring and managing the sustainability of agricultural resources. However, there are still challenges in timely mapping of crop types and planting areas to support production during the present growing season. Here, we proposed to use time-series Sentinel-2 imagery and a deep learning method for major crop mapping (wheat, maize, sunflower, and squash) in the agricultural production areas in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID), Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. A feature selection method that combines the global separability index and feature recursive elimination was proposed to optimize the band features of Sentinel-2 imagery. The Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, U-Net and deeplabv3+ algorithms were then used for image classification with all spectral bands and the selected band features, respectively. The selected bands and best method were used to determine the key time window for the early identification of four major crops. Integrate all image datasets in the early window period, and build mapping models suitable for images at different times in the window period by combining the selected bands and best method. The results showed that the proposed feature selection method effectively removed redundant features and improved the classification efficiency. The U-Net algorithm was more suitable for the classification of major crops in HID with a higher accuracy whether using all band features or the selected features. The key periods for early recognition of wheat, maize, sunflower, and squash in HID were mid-May, late June, early July, and late June, respectively. The constructed models for crop type mapping in the early period were tested in 2020 and 2021 in the HID, and the F1-score, the mean intersection-over-union and overall accuracy were 86.71 %, 84.66 %, and 98.89 %, respectively. The proposed feature selection method, U-Net classification algorithm, and screening of the early mapping window period in this study provide an efficient, accurate and timely crop mapping tool in HID. Future research can further verify the applicability of the early identification time window proposed in this study to support other agricultural management activities in the areas."
866;Predicting wheat gluten concentrations in potato starch using GPR and SVM models built by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy;"Qingxia Li a , Tong Lei a , Yunlong Cheng b , Xin Wei a , Da-Wen Sun a,*";"The purpose of this study was for the first time to explore the feasibility of terahertz (THz) spectral imaging for the detection of gluten contents in food samples. Based on the obtained 80 THz spectrum data, Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM) models were established to predict wheat gluten concentrations in 40 potato starch mixture samples. The prediction performances of GPR and SVM obtained were R2 = 0.859 and RMSE = 0.070, and R2 = 0.715 and RMSE = 0.101 in the gluten concentration range of 1.3%-100%, respectively, showing that the linear SVM algorithm had better prediction performance. The results indicated that THz spectral imaging combined with GPR could be used to predict the gluten content in food samples. It is thus hoped that this research should provide a novel technique for gluten content detection to ensure gluten-free food samples."

Moreover, when the SVM includes feature selection, the model becomes hard to solve. In this paper, we present an alternative SVM model with feature selection and the performance of the new classifiers is compared to those of the classical soft margin model through some performance metrics based on the confusion matrix: the area under the ROC curve, Cohen?s Kappa coefficient and the F-Score. Both the classical soft margin SVM model with feature selection and our proposal have been implemented by metaheuristics, given the complexity of the models to solve."
868;Support Vector Machine in Precision Agriculture: A review;"Zhi Hong Kok a , Abdul Rashid Mohamed Shariff a,b,c,* , Meftah Salem M. Alfatni d , Siti Khairunniza-Bejo a,b,c";"The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm which may be used for acquiring solutions towards better crop management. The applications of SVM in precision agriculture (PA) are compared by identifying its interactions with variables, comparing its model performance, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses, as well as suggestions for improvements. From the perspective of six ML applications in PA, we confirmed features which may benefit the model in general (e.g. feature selection) or specific applications (e.g. phenology). SVM was found to outperform most models, with an inconclusive comparison with Random Forest (RF) and inferior to Deep Learning (DL). To our knowledge, this review highlights and summarizes recently renewed efforts of improving SVM performance in PA through its integration with DL, which is believed to be an upcoming trend for ML model development in modern PA."
869;Towards a semantic structure for classifying IoT agriculture sensor datasets : An approach based on machine learning and web semantic technologies;"Djakhdjakha Lynda a,? , Farou Brahim a , Seridi Hamid a , CissHamadoun b";"With the increase in the number of IoT farming datasets, it has become so difficult to identify the right data for IoT agriculture applications. Therefore, a meaningful structure is needed to well understand, interpret and index IoT farming datasets. This paper proposes a new IoT farming ontology that allows the organization, the understanding, and the classification of IoT agriculture datasets knowledge as well as meta-data storage. For this, we have developed a new IoT agriculture taxonomy that helps to identify an IoT agriculture application based on the combination of various IoT agriculture sensors. The evaluation of the semantic IoT agriculture datasets classification, based on the background knowledge provided by the proposed ontology, was achieved using Machine Learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Neighbors Classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian NB, SVM, and Random Forest Regressor. The obtained results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed ontology to classify IoT agriculture datasets with high performances and accuracy (0.98), (0.99) using Decision tree classifier and SVM respectively"
870;Performance of precision poverty alleviation through circular economy based on RS-SVM model in the context of rural revitalization;Jiazhou Zhou;"With the implementation of the rural revitalization strategy, the precision poverty alleviation through circular economy has become an important means of promoting rural development. In order to study the performance of circular economy precision poverty alleviation in rural revitalization, a performance research method based on Support Vector Machines is proposed. During the process, the rough set was introduced for the hidden feature analysis, and a precise poverty alleviation performance indicator system was established. Afterwards, the performance evaluation model was constructed and the genetic algorithm was introduced for parameter optimization. Finally, the performance of the research method was tested. The experimental results show that the research method only requires 15 evolutions to achieve a fitness value of approximately 0.021. In the test of the calculation results, the research method only had 2 points on the test set that differed by more than 0.2 from the standard value. In the F1 test, the research method increased to approximately 97.6 after 200 iterations on the test set. When conducting empirical analysis, the evaluation results obtained by the research method are basically consistent with the expert evaluation results. These results indicate that the research method has good performance and can accurately evaluate the performance of precision poverty alleviation, providing reference for poverty alleviation work."
871;Feature selection and classification improvement of Kinnow using SVM classifier;"Sukhpreet Singh * , Kamal Malik";"An approach to enhance the classification of the kinnow is proposed in this paper. The fruit images are captured in the proposed approach, and texture, color, shape, and size features are extracted and merged to generate a dataset. To cope with outliers and dominant features, the Pareto normalization method is used. A hybrid feature selection approach that combines neighborhood component analysis and ReliefF methods to select the optimal features is proposed to eliminate redundant and irrelevant features. The dataset is classified using the SVM machine learning algorithm following the feature selection. Utilizing the SVM classifier, the proposed approach chooses 54.20% of the features with an accuracy of 94.67%. This proves that the proposed approach is efficient and can be used for the classification of the other fruits."
872;Automatic scoring of postures in grouped pigs using depth image and CNN-SVM;"Jinyang Xu a , Suyin Zhou a,* , Aijun Xu a,* , Junhua Ye b , Ayong Zhao c,d";"Animal posture is a manifestation of animal behavior, and an animal?s behavior provides information about their health, welfare, and living environment. In recent years, machine vision and machine learning technologies have been widely used to detect individual or group behavior of pigs. The purpose of this study is to use machine vision and deep learning technologies to recognize and score multiple postures (standing, sitting, sternal recumbency, ventral recumbency and lateral recumbency) of pigs under commercial conditions based on depth images. In this study, the Azure Kinect DK depth camera with a top view was used to obtain the depth image of pigs, and the target pig image was obtained by GrabCut image segmentation and watershed segmentation of target object calibration. Then, based on the characteristics of the image, the convex hull, boundary, and the depth distance of the shoulder and the hip were obtained. The ratio of the convex hull perimeter to the boundary and the ratio of the convex hull area to the boundary, as well as the depth distance of the shoulder and the hip, and the depth distance ratio of the shoulder to the hip were obtained as the input of the Convolutional Neural Network-Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM) classification model, and the model was trained and tested. In various classifier detection experiments, the performance of our pig posture classifier for standing posture and lateral recumbency posture was better, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) values being 0.9969 and 0.9967, respectively. However, the performance of sitting posture, sternal recumbency posture and ventral recumbency posture classifier was slightly worse but still had good performance: AUC values were 0.9790, 0.9355 and 0.9795, respectively. The model in this article was used to detect the average postures of pigs in one day (taking the average for eight consecutive days), and it was found that the proportion of lying postures was higher than other postures (lying postures were 72%, standing postures were 20%, and sitting postures were 8%). The proportion of standing postures in the daytime was higher than that in the evening, and lying posture was the opposite. The proportion of the three lying postures also changes over time. This study compared the difference of posture recognition accuracy between the model in this paper (CNN-SVM), SVM and CNN using the same training data and experimental data, the accuracy of posture recognition of the three models was 94.6368%, 92.2175% and 90.5396%, respectively. Therefore, the recognition accuracy of the model in this paper was improved greatly compared with CNN and SVM."
873;Segmentation algorithm for overlap recognition of seedling lettuce and weeds based on SVM and image blocking;"Lei Zhang a,b , Zhien Zhang a , Chuanyu Wu a,b,* , Liang Sun a,b";"For the problem of a low recognition rate and shape feature failure caused by overlapping seedlings and weeds during the development of an intelligent lettuce weeding robot, a method to identify seedling lettuce and weeds based on an image block and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed, which realizes their precise identification and boundary segmentation. The a* channel is used to grayscale the collected image. The Otsu and morphological methods are selected to extract all the green targets in the image. The connected component analysis method is applied to label the green targets with regions of interest (ROIs), and those with pixel areas larger than the area threshold are normalized to 256 ? 256 pixels. The image blocking technique is introduced to separately aliquot the normalized ROI, with block sizes of 16 ? 16, 32 ? 32, and 64 ? 64 pixels. On this basis, the image sub-blocks are manually labeled, block by block, to extract three texture features: histogram of oriented gradient (HOG), local binary pattern (LBP), and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). With the accuracy of fivefold cross-validation as the optimization objective, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the SVM penalty and kernel parameters of 21 groups of research objects (one block size has three texture features, which are arbitrarily combined to form seven research objects, with a total of three block sizes). We compare the recognition performance of the SVM, RF, KNN, and GA-SVM classifiers in a single feature and a combination of fusion strategies through comparative analysis. When the block size is 32 ? 32 pixels, the fusion of LBP and GLCM features under the GA-SVM classifier has the highest accuracy, and the optimal SVM model for the identification of lettuce and weeds in the seedling stage is obtained. For the misidentified image sub-blocks in optimization model recognition, an image block reconstruction method based on the comparison of the center point and eight-neighbor label value is proposed, and this is combined with the proportion of image blocks of two labels for comprehensive judgment. The center point label value is reconstructed to the improve recognition accuracy. Experimental results show that the average precision, recall, and F1 score of the proposed method are 0.9473, 0.9529, and 0.9498, respectively, and those of images without overlapping leaves can all reach 1, thus providing a theoretical basis for crop recognition and segmentation."
874;"Rapid detection of soil carbonates by means of NIR spectroscopy, deep learning methods and phase quantification by powder X-ray diffraction.";"Lykourgos Chiniadisa , Petros Tamvakisa";"Soil near-Infrared (NIR) spectral absorbance/reflectance libraries are utilized towards improving agricultural production and analysis of soil properties which are key prerequisite for agro-ecological balance and environmental sustainability. Carbonates in particular, represent a soil property which is mostly affected even by mild, let alone extreme, changes of environmental conditions during climate change. In this study we propose a rapid and efficient way to predict carbonates content in soil by means of Fourier Transform Near-Infrared (FT-NIR) reflectance spectroscopy and by use of deep learning methods. We exploited multiple machine learning methods, such as: 1) a Multi-Layered Perceptron Regressor (MLP) and 2) a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and compare their performance with other traditional machine learning algorithms such as Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Cubist and Support Vector Machines (SVM) on the combined dataset of two NIR spectral libraries: Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), a dataset of soil samples reflectance spectra collected nationwide, and Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) TopSoil (European Soil Library) which contains soil sample absorbance spectra from all over the European Union, and use them to predict carbonate content on never-before-seen soil samples. Soil samples in KSSL and in TopSoil spectral libraries were acquired in the spectral region of visible?near infrared (Vis-NIR) (350-2500 nm), however in this study, only the NIR spectral region (1150-2500 nm) was utilized. Quantification of carbonates by means of X-ray-Diffraction is in good agreement with the volumetric method and the MLP prediction. Our work contributes to rapid carbonates content prediction in soil samples in cases where: 1) no volumetric method is available and 2) only NIR spectra absorbance data are available. Up till now and to the best of our knowledge, there exists no other study, that presents a prediction model trained on such an extensive dataset with such promising results on unseen data, undoubtedly supporting the notion that deep learning models present excellent prediction tools for soil carbonates content."

Waqas (muhammadwaqas2k18@gmail.com)";"The tomato is one of the most important fruits on earth. It is rich in nutrients, has the best taste, and has other good health benefits. It plays an important and useful role in the agricultural production of any country. An increase in tomato diseases causes an increase in the import of tomatoes, which affects the economy of the country. This research improved the dataset with an increase in images from the field (the Plant Village dataset) and proposed a hybrid algorithm composed of support vector machines (SVM) and histogram-oriented gradients (HOG) for real-time detection of late blight tomato disease. The use of the proposed hybrid algorithm in the smart agriculture field for the detection of late blight on tomatoes would increase and protect its production.

To check the performance of the proposed model in terms of MSE, accuracy, precision, and recall as compared to Decision Tree and KNN. The integration of advanced technology in agriculture has the potential to revolutionize the industry, making it more efficient, sustainable, and profitable. This research work on the early detection of tomato diseases contributes to the growing importance of smart farming, the need for climate-smart agriculture, the rising need to more efficiently utilize natural resources, and the demand for higher crop yields. The proposed hybrid algorithm of SVM and HOG has significant potential for the early detection of late blight disease in tomato plants. The performance of the proposed model against decision tree and KNN algorithms and the results may assist in selecting the best algorithm for future applications. The research work can help farmers make data-driven decisions to optimize crop yield and quality while also reducing the environmental impact of farming practices."
876;Detection of Late Blight Disease in Tomato Leaf Using Image Processing Techniques;"Muhammad Shoaib Farooq1 , Tabir Arif1 , Shamyla Riaz1";"One of the most frequently farmed crops is the tomato crop. Late blight is the most prevalent tomato disease in the world, and often causes a significant reduction in the production of tomato crops. The importance of tomatoes as an agricultural product necessitates early detection of late blight. It is produced by the fungus Phytophthora. The earliest signs of late blight on tomatoes are unevenly formed, water-soaked lesions on the leaves located on the plant canopys younger leave White cottony growth may appear in humid environments evident on the undersides of the leaves that have been impacted. Lesions increase as the disease proceeds, turning the leaves brown to shrivel up and die. Using picture segmentation and the Multi-class SVM technique, late blight disorder is discovered in this work. Image segmentation is employed for separating damaged areas on leaves, and the Multi-class SVM method is used for reliable disease categorization. 30 reputable studies were chosen from a total of 2770 recognized papers. The primary goal of this study is to compile cutting-edge research that identifies current research trends, problems, and prospects for late blight detection. It also looks at current approaches for applying image processing to diagnose and detect late blight. A suggested taxonomy for late blight detection has also been provided. In the same way, a model for the development of the solutions to problems is also presented. Finally, the research gaps have been presented in terms of open issues for the provision of future directions in image processing for the researchers."
877;Using Machine Learning to generate an open-access cropland map from satellite images time series in the Indian Himalayan Region;"Danya Li 1, 2 , Joaquin Gajardo 1 , Michele Volpi 3 , Thijs Defraeye 1,*";"Crop maps are crucial for agricultural monitoring and food management and can additionally support domain-specific applications, such as setting cold supply chain infrastructure in developing countries. Machine learning (ML) models, combined with freely-available satellite imagery, can be used to produce cost-effective and high spatial-resolution crop maps. However, accessing ground truth data for supervised learning is especially challenging in developing countries due to factors such as smallholding and fragmented geography, which often results in a lack of crop type maps or even reliable cropland maps. Our area of interest for this study lies in Himachal Pradesh, India, where we aim at producing an open-access binary cropland map at 10-meter resolution for the Kullu, Shimla, and Mandi districts. To this end, we developed an ML pipeline that relies on Sentinel-2 satellite images time series. We investigated two pixel-based supervised classifiers, support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF), which are used to classify per-pixel time series for binary cropland mapping. The ground truth data used for training, validation and testing was manually annotated from a combination of field survey reference points and visual interpretation of very high resolution (VHR) imagery. We trained and validated the models via spatial cross-validation to account for local spatial autocorrelation and selected the RF model due to overall robustness and lower computational cost. We tested the generalization capability of the chosen model at the pixel level by computing the accuracy, recall, precision, and F1- score on hold-out test sets of each district, achieving an average accuracy for the RF (our best model) of 87%. We used this model to generate a cropland map for three districts of Himachal Pradesh,spanning 14,600 km2 , which improves the resolution and quality of existing public maps."

The common goal of all computer vision-based precision agriculture tasks is to detect the objects of interest (e.g., crop, weed) and discriminating them from the background. The Weeds are unwanted plants growing among crops competing for nutrients, water, and sunlight, causing losses to crop yields. Weed detection and mapping is critical for sitespecific weed management to reduce the cost of labor and impact of herbicides. This paper investigates the use of color and texture features for discrimination of Soybean crops and weeds. Feature extraction methods including two color spaces (RGB, HSV), gray level Co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) are used to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experiment was carried out on image dataset of soybean crop, obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which is publicly available. The results from the experiment showed that the highest accuracy (above 96%) was obtained from the combination of color and LBP features."

We see as time passes, significant changes come in the present era, which begins with Green Revolution. Due to improper knowledge of plant diseases, farmers use fertilizers in excess, which ultimately degrade the quality of food. Earlier farmers use experts to determine the type of plant disease, which was expensive and time-consuming. In today?s time, Image processing is used to recognize and catalog plant diseases using the lesion region of plant leaf, and there are different modus-operandi for plant disease scent from leaf using Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and others.

Brendac , D. Di Giuseppec , A. De Ninnoa , M. Solfrizzob , E. Martinellic , A. Gerardinoa";"Aflatoxins are fungal metabolites extensively produced by many different fungal species that may contaminate a wide range of agricultural food products. They have been studied extensively because of being associated with various chronic and acute diseases especially immunosuppression and cancer and their presence in food is strictly monitored and regulated worldwide. Aflatoxin detection and measurement relies mainly on chemical methods usually based on chromatography approaches, and recently developed immunochemical based assays that have advantages but also limitations, since these are expensive and destructive techniques. Nondestructive, optical approaches are recently being developed to assess presence of contamination in a cost and time effective way, maintaining acceptable accuracy and reproducibility. In this paper are presented the results obtained with a simple portable device for nondestructive detection of aflatoxins in almonds. The presented approach is based on the analysis of fluorescence spectra of slurried almonds under 375 nm wavelength excitation. Experiments were conducted with almonds contaminated in the range of 2.7-320.2 ng/g total aflatoxins B (AFB1 + AFB2) as determined by HPLC/FLD. After applying pre-processing steps, spectral analysis was carried out by a binary classification model based on SVM algorithm. A majority vote procedure was then performed on the classification results. In this way we could achieve, as best result, a classification accuracy of 94% (and false negative rate 5%) with a threshold set at 6.4 ng/g. These results illustrate the feasibility of such an approach in the great challenge of aflatoxin detection for food and feed safety."
881;Amateur Drones Detection: A machine learning approach utilizing the acoustic signals in the presence of strong interference;"Zahoor Uddin1 , Muhammad Altaf 1 , Muhammad Bilal 2,* , Lewis Nkenyereye 3,* , Ali Kashif Bashir4";"Owing to small size, sensing capabilities and autonomous nature, the Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) have enormous applications in various areas e.g., remote sensing, navigation, archaeology, journalism, environmental science, and agriculture. However, the un-monitored deployment of UAVs called the amateur drones (AmDr) can lead to serious security threats and risk to human life and infrastructure. Therefore, timely detection of the AmDr is essential for the protection and security of sensitive organizations, human life and other vital infrastructure. AmDrs can be detected using different techniques based on sound, video, thermal, and radio  requencies. However, the performance of these techniques is limited in sever atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we propose an efficient un-supervise machine learning approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to detect various acoustic signals i.e., sounds of bird, airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and the UAVs in practical scenario. After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), the power spectral density (PSD) and the Root Mean Square Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM)and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)to detect the presence or absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic interfering signals. The proposed technique is verified through extensive simulations and it is observed that the RMS values of PSD with KNN performs better than the MFCC with KNN and SVM."

885;In-Field Peduncle Detection of Sweet Peppers for Robotic Harvesting: a comparative study;"Chris Lehnert* , Chris McCool* and Tristan Perez";"Robotic harvesting of crops has the potential to disrupt current agricultural practices. A key element to enabling robotic harvesting is to safely remove the crop from the plant which often involves locating and cutting the peduncle, the part of the crop that attaches it to the main stem of the plant. In this paper we present a comparative study of two methods for performing peduncle detection. The first method is based on classic colour and geometric features obtained from the scene with a support vector machine classifier, referred to as PFHSVM. The second method is an efficient deep neural network approach, MiniInception, that is able to be deployed on a robotic platform. In both cases we employ a secondary filtering process that enforces reasonable assumptions about the crop structure, such as the proximity of the peduncle to the crop. Our tests are conducted on Harvey, a sweet pepper harvesting robot, and is evaluated in a greenhouse using two varieties of sweet pepper, Ducati and Mercuno. We demonstrate that the MiniInception method achieves impressive accuracy and considerably outperforms the PFH-SVM approach achieving an F1 score of 0.564 and 0.302 respectively"
886;Effective Sequential Classifier Training for SVM-Based Multitemporal Remote Sensing Image Classification;"Yiqing Guo, Student Member, IEEE, Xiuping Jia, Senior Member, IEEE, and David Paull,";"The explosive availability of remote sensing images has challenged supervised classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), as training samples tend to be highly limited due to the expensive and laborious task of ground truthing. The temporal correlation and spectral similarity between multitemporal images have opened up an opportunity to alleviate this problem. In this study, a SVM-based Sequential Classifier Training (SCT-SVM) approach is proposed for multitemporal remote sensing image classification. The approach leverages the classifiers of previous images to reduce the required number of training samples for the classifier training of an incoming image. For each incoming image, a rough classifier is firstly predicted based on the temporal trend of a set of previous classifiers. The predicted classifier is then fine-tuned into a more accurate position with current training samples. This approach can be applied progressively to sequential image data, with only a small number of training samples being required from each image. Experiments were conducted with Sentinel-2A multitemporal data over an agricultural area in Australia. Results showed that the proposed SCT-SVM achieved better classification accuracies compared with two state-of-the-art model transfer algorithms. When training data are insufficient, the overall classification accuracy of the incoming image was improved from 76.18% to 94.02% with the proposed SCT-SVM, compared with those obtained without the assistance from previous images. These results demonstrate that the leverage of a priori information from previous images can provide advantageous assistance for later images in multitemporal image classification."

The Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) was installed on the quota fishing vessels to collect work data from June 16, 2021 to July 13, 2021. According to the characteristics of the fishing vessels, the work status of the fishing vessels was divided into five statuses such as stopping, sailing, putting net, waiting and pulling net. The 3D convolutional neural network Acetes3DNet was designed to extract the multi-dimensional and multi-level features of the data and trained in the training set. Finally, the effectiveness of the model was verified in the validation set. The training results were combined with the Beidou ship position data to restore the working process of the fishing vessel. The experimental results reveal that after 150 epochs of training, the precision, recall, and f1 score of Acetes3DNet on the training set reached 99.02%, 99.19%, and 99.09%, respectively, while the precision, recall, and f1 score on the validation set reached 97.09%, 96.82%, and 96.68%. Research shows that Acetes3DNet can circumvent the limitations of traditional 2D neural networks in dynamic target detection, complete recognition of the working status of Acetes chinensis quota fishing vessels, and show the historical work process of the ship in an intuitive manner.

889;Predicting the Impact of Climate Change on Tidal Zone Fishes Using SVM Approach;"R.Jeberson Retna Raj*, T.Sasipraba, M.Vasudev, Sanjay Gupta, Md.Rizwan, Piyush srivastava";"Climate change is the most important topic discussed among countries due to the damage it made to the environment. The impact of the climate change influences the people and marine fisheries directly and indirectly. The implication of climate change resulted into rising sea level, changes of pattern in coastal landscape, missing seasonal rainfall, tsunami etc. Rising of temperature is one such impact which affects the marine fisheries. The marine fishes are drifted from their conventional ocean zone into different places because of the absence of favorable environment. In Indian Ocean (IO), the seasonal catchments of customary fishes like sardine, pelagic and demersal are reduced due to the aberrant pattern of climate change. If the trend is continue, the problem of lack of catchment, over fishing is to be happened in the near future. This paper presents the details of these conventional fishes and analyse their decline in catchment due to climate change. Furthermore, the historical data of these fish catchment is taken for predicting the future trend. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is employed for predicting the nature of these fishes. The system is tested with the available datasets and the test result shows the efficiency of the proposed system"
890;An example of fishery yield predictions from VMS-based navigational characteristics applied to double trawlers in China;"Qi Liu a , Yunxia Chen b , Jing Wang a , Haihong Miao c , Yingbin Wang a,";"Vessel monitoring systems (VMSs) provide information on the spatial and temporal distribution of fishing vessels operating at sea and are mostly used for fisheries enforcement and vessel surveillance. VMS has potential shortcomings in fisheries resource assessment due to its inability to acquire information on catch yields. This study proposed a method for predicting fishing vessel yield based on VMS data. Speed, heading difference and track characteristics were used to determine the state of VMS data for three double trawlers (Zhepuyu 71319, 71528 and 71568) in 2021. Then, fishing effort and temporal and spatial features were calculated for each trip based on the VMS data of the dragging state. Finally, six machine learning (ML) models (k-Nearest Neighbor [KNN], Random Forest[RF], Support Vector Machine[SVM], eXtreme Gradient Boosting[XGBoost], Gradient Boosting Decision Tree[GBDT] and Ridge Regression[RR]) were used to predict the yield of the double trawlers per trip. Two of the three double trawlers were used in turn as the training set to construct the prediction model, and the other one was utilised as the test set to evaluate the model performance. The prediction results were evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coefficient of determinant (R2 ) and model prediction error per trip. The prediction error of the total yield per year was calculated. Results showed that the six ML models exhibited high prediction performance and affirmed the accuracy of yield prediction, and the performance of the models varied with the dataset. XGBoost, GBDT and KNN had the best prediction performance when Zhepuyu 71319, 71528 and 71568 were used as the test set, respectively. Moreover, the total yield errors of all models were less than 10 %. This study selected multiple features to construct ML models to predict the yield of double trawlers based on the navigation characteristics of double trawlers and further explored the VMS data to improve the assessment methods of fishery resources, enabling the VMS data to play a greater role in aiding scientific decisions."
891;The effect of extratropical cyclone weather conditions on fishing vessel incidents? severity level in Atlantic Canada;"Sara Rezaee a,? , Ronald Pelot a , Joel Finnis b";"Fishing is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. In addition to the high risk of fatality, fish harvesters are also at risk of a wide range of non-fatal injuries during their work at sea. Weather factors are an intrinsic part of fish harvesters? operating environment and they consider the most dangerous situations at sea to be associated with weather-related factors. This research aims to answer questions regarding the effects of extratropical cyclone weather conditions on the severity level of maritime incidents to provide more insight for fish harvesters and/or marine traffic decision makers such as the Canadian Coast Guard. To achieve these goals, weather and incident data in Atlantic Canadian waters were matched spatially and temporally then analyzed to explore their relationships. Logistic Regression was used to examine how weather factors affect the severity level of fishing vessel incidents. Ice concentration, wind speed, sea surface temperature, and darkness were the most significant environmental factors with respect to severity level of fishing incidents. When only incidents associated with cyclones were taken into consideration, Laplacian of pressure as an indicator of cyclone?s intensity replaced ice concentration as a significant factor. Logistic Regression was also applied for individual fishery types, revealing that distinct fisheries can be affected by different weather factors. Improving our understanding of extreme events and revising safety related policies in commercial fishing is particularly important under climate change scenarios as fish harvesters? reliance on traditional weather patterns becomes increasingly questionable."
892;Country of origin label monitoring of musky and common octopuses (Eledone spp. and Octopus vulgaris) by means of a portable near-infrared spectroscopic device;"Maria Olga Varra` , Sergio Ghidini , Maria Pia Fabrile , Adriana Ianieri , Emanuela Zanardi";"Modern analytical techniques using miniaturized and portable near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy instruments are particularly suited for assessing the authenticity of fishery products since meeting the requirements of rapidity, eco-friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and easiness of application. The objective of the present study was to verify the suitability of use of a portable and ultra-compact NIR spectrometer combined with machine learning to characterize the geographic origin of two octopus species. Replicate NIR spectra (908.1?1676.2 nm) of 118 musky and 29 common octopus specimens (Eledone spp. and Octopus vulgaris) from Portuguese Atlantic or Spanish Mediterranean fishing areas were recorded, pre-processed and elaborated via the following classification algorithms: orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron-artificial neural network (MLP-ANN). When 7-fold cross validation was performed on 75% of data, the results showed that linear tools (OPLS-DA and LR) were the most powerful and stable techniques in recognizing the origin of both octopus species (mean sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision values above 98%). During the external validation phase OPLSDA, SVM, and MLP-ANN performed better for common octopuses, while LR and MLP-ANN for musky octopuses. The achieved outcomes suggest the combination of portable NIR spectroscopy and machine learning as a promising plan of action to be adopted for the creation of an integrated analytical platform with capabilities for automated data recording, processing, and reporting, which may be helpful for on-site and in-line monitoring of fishery products."
893;A novel diagnostic SNP panel for fishery management of green abalone (Haliotis fulgens).;"Mej?-Ru? Paulina a , Perez-Enriquez Ricardo a , Severin Andrew b , Mart?ez-Rincon ? Ra? Octavio c , Garza John Carlos d , Mares-Mayagoitia Jorge Alberto a , Valenzuela-Quinonez ? Fausto a,";"The green abalone (Haliotis fulgens) represents an important artisanal fishery in the Northwest Pacific in Mexico but with populations below the optimum recovery level. Illegal fishing and the potential impact on wild populations because of the stock enhancement programs would benefit from a genomic tool to discriminate among populations and provide traceability. In this study, SNP panels for green abalone were developed from ddRad-seq data and used to evaluate individual assignment accuracy at two hierarchical scales. One included three genetic groups: 1) Guadalupe Island (GI), 2) Northern Coastal Group (NCG) and 3) Southern Coastal Group (SCG) and the second only the two coastal groups. Eight SNP panels (from 50 to 1000 loci), with markers ranked by FST, were evaluated to assess the power to identify individuals from the three genetic groups at both scales. The predictive model found high discriminatory power for almost all the SNP datasets for two of the three groups (GI and SCG), ranging from 0.72 (s.d. = 0.32) to 1. At the coastal scale, assignment accuracies for NCG individuals varied substantially with the number of SNP markers, ranging from 0.01 (s.d. = 0.05) with the 50 most informative SNPs to 0.79 (s.d. = 0.30) using 1000 SNPs. These SNP panels will provide genetic tools for tracing the origin of green abalone in the food-supply chain, which will assist fishing cooperatives in certifying their products and tackling illegal fishing in M?exico."
894;"Application of machine learning algorithms and Sentinel-2 satellite for improved bathymetry retrieval in Lake Victoria, Tanzania";"Makemie J. Mabula a,* , Danielson Kisanga b , Siajali Pamba a";"Estimating bathymetric information is vital for aquaculture and navigation applications. Free, high-resolution satellite imagery provides a cost-effective solution for routine bathymetric measurements. We tested six algorithms to retrieve water depth in the Mwanza Gulf of Lake Victoria using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery: the conventional Stumpf method, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Neural Network (NNET), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In-situ depth points collected via echo sounders were used to train and validate the algorithms. Performance evaluation metrics included coefficient of determination (R2 ), mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and spatial autocorrelation of residuals. Among the algorithms tested, the Stumpf model exhibited moderate performance with an R2 of 0.441, higher MAE (2.078 m), and RMSE (2.964 m) values. The RF algorithm improved performance with an R2 of 0.957, lower MAE (0.476 m), and RMSE (0.823 m). The GBM and XGB algorithms achieved R2 values of 0.960 and 0.956, respectively, with low MAE (0.484 m for GBM, 0.482 m for XGB) and RMSE (0.795 m for GBM, 0.830 m for XGB) values. The NNET algorithm outperformed the GBM and XGB models, obtaining an R2 of 0.963, the lowest MAE (0.438 m), and RMSE (0.761 m). The SVM algorithm demonstrated the best performance with an R2 of 0.965, the lowest MAE (0.403 m), and RMSE (0.745 m), implying the highest accuracy in depth estimation. SVM also showed stable generalization across different locations with insignificant spatial autocorrelation of residuals. Therefore, SVM is recommended for repetitive bathymetry calculations."
895;"Use of data-driven models to analyse the habitat preferences of the leaping grey mullet (Chelon saliens, Risso, 1810) in the Caspian Sea";"Rahmat Zarkami a,* , Pourya Bahri a , Hasan Fazli b , Ali Haghi Vayghan c , Roghayeh Sadeghi Pasvisheh d";"Identifying the most important independent environmental variables affecting the habitat preferences of marine fish species is very important for a proper and effective fisheries management in marine ecosystems. Classification tree (CT) and support vector machine (SVM) were implemented to examine the habitat preferences of the leaping grey mullet (Chelon saliens) in various sampling locations situated in the southern part of the Caspian Sea. The CT model (with the highest level of pruning) confirmed that the deepest part of the sea may not provide a favourite place to the fish population, while the probability of fish presence may increase with high photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Based on the model?s decision, increasing the sand percentage (SP) may lead to the decrease of the presence of suitable conditions for the mullet population. The outcomes of SVM model (in terms of the attribute weight) also demonstrated that the deepest part of sea and high SP may restrict the potential area of the fish population. On the contrary, an increase in the amount of PAR, sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level anomaly (SLA) may lead to an increase in the presence of fish. The attribute weight of SVM model also showed that total organic matter (TOM), sediment type, sea surface chlorophylla (chla) and benthic biomass had a low contribution to the mullet?s prediction. Both models, thus, identified the most important variables influencing the habitat preferences of the mullet. Determining the key variables influencing the habitat preferences of the fish allows to identify the mullet?s feeding behaviour in the sea. The identified variables can be valuable for evaluating the habitat preferences of the mullet species in other coastal tropical and temperate ecosystems worldwide with similar and comparable ecological patterns as the Caspian Sea."
896;"Effect of polynomial, radial basis, and Pearson VII function kernels in support vector machine algorithm for classification of crayfish";"Farid Hassanbaki Garabaghi a , Recep Benzer b , Semra Benzer c,* , Aysel ?aglan ? Gal a";"Freshwater crayfish are one of the most important aquatic organisms that play a pivotal role in the aquatic food chain as well as serving as bioindicators for the aquatic ecosystem health assessment. Hemocytes, the blood cells of crustaceans, can be considered stress and health indicators in crayfish, and are used to evaluate the health response. Therefore, total hemocyte cell numbers (THCs) are useful parameters to show the health of crustaceans and serve as stress indicators to decide the quality of the habitat. Since, catching the fish and the other aquatic organisms, and collecting the data for further assessments are time-consuming and frustrating, today, scientists tend to use swift, more sophisticated, and more reliable methods for modeling the ecosystem stressors based on bioindicators. One tool which has attracted the attention of science communities in the last decades is machine learning algorithms that are reliable and accurate methods to solve classification and regression problems. In this study, a support vector machine is carried out as a machine learning algorithm to classify healthy and unhealthy crayfish based on physiological characteristics. To solve the non-linearity problem of the data by transporting data to high-dimensional space, different kernel functions including polynomial (PK), Pearson VII function-based universal (PUK), and radial basis function (RBF) kernels are used and their effect on the performance of the SVM model was evaluated. Both PK and PUK functions performed well in classifying the crayfish. RBF, however, had an adverse impact on the performance of the model. PUK kernel exhibited an outstanding performance (Accuracy = 100%) for the classification of the healthy and unhealthy crayfish."
897;Detection of invalid AIS messages using machine learning techniques;"Jessica N.A. Campbella *, Anthony W. Isenora , Martha Dais Ferreirab";"Coastal nations monitor maritime activities in the interest of defence, security, and safety. This form of monitoring typically occurs at operations centers that visualize the maritime environment by creating a Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP) covering a particular area of interest. The creation of this picture changed drastically with the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS messages are known to contain numerous types of errors and in April 2020 a unique error was found in the data stream. This error consisted of messages indicating the appearance of over 200 vessels in the North Atlantic taking part in a yacht race when in fact no race or physical ships existed. The following work explores the application of various machine learning (ML) techniques to help identify these types of fabricated AIS messages. Specific ML techniques were explored including: K-means clustering, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-SVM). The results showed that DT, RF, and FNN best identified the fabricated AIS messages with F1 scores greater than 93 percent on the test data."
898;Analysis of Alburnus tarichi population by machine learning classification methods for sustainable fisheries;Yasemin G?LTEPE*;"An endemic carp species, Alburnus tarichi, inhabits Van Lake Basin in Turkey, where approximately 10,000 tons of this economical and anadromous species are caught each year. Until now, the A. tarichi population has been statistically analyzed based only on caught fish, which provides insufficient information. When these fish reach maturity, do they go to the water sources where their parents spawn, as do salmon? If Alburnus tarichi go to the same locations as their parents to spawn and hatch, then new strains of this species will start forming over time. This study applies two machine learning classification algorithms, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and support vector machine (SVM), to an original dataset for A. tarichi population analysis. Fish from nine areas were caught to prepare the original dataset. Five strains were found with machine learning classification algorithms in the Van Lake Basin, and results show that the accuracy levels of the k-NN algorithm were superior to those of the SVM algorithm in the population analysis of Alburnus tarichi."
899;Multivariate versus machine learning-based classification of rapid evaporative Ionisation mass spectrometry spectra towards industry based large-scale fish speciation;"Marilyn De Graeve a,1 , Nicholas Birse b,1 , Yunhe Hong b , Christopher T. Elliott b,c , Lieselot Y. Hemeryck a,2 , Lynn Vanhaecke a,b,*";"Detection and prevention of fish food fraud are of ever-increasing importance, prompting the need for rapid, high-throughput fish speciation techniques. Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) has quickly established itself as a powerful technique for the instant in situ analysis of foodstuffs. In the current study, a total of 1736 samples (20152021) - comprising 17 different commercially valuable fish species - were analysed using iKnife-REIMS, followed by classification with various multivariate and machine learning strategies. The results demonstrated that multivariate models, i.e. PCA-LDA and (O)PLS-DA, delivered accuracies from 92.5 to 100.0%, while RF and SVM-based classification generated accuracies from 88.7 to 96.3%. Real-time recognition on a separate test set of 432 samples (2022) generated correct speciation between 89.6 and 99.5% for the multivariate models, while the ML models underperformed (22.395.1%), in particular for the white fish species. As such, we propose a real-time validated modelling strategy using directly amenable PCA-LDA for rapid industry-proof large-scale fish speciation."
900;Model selection between traditional and popular methods for standardizing catch rates of target species: A case study of Japanese Spanish mackerel in the gillnet fishery;"Zengguang Li, Zhenjiang Ye*, Rong Wan, Chi Zhang";"Improving existing catch per unit effort (CPUE) models for construction of a fishery abundance index is important to fish stock assessment and management. CPUE standardization research is a rapidly developing field, and many statistical models have been used, including generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs), regression trees (RTs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, the popular and influential methods, random forests (RFs) and support vector machines (SVMs) have not been used in this field. We evaluate the performance of six candidate methods (GLMs, GAMs, RTs, RFs, ANNs and SVMs) using gillnet data for Japanese Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus niphonius) collected by a fishery-dependent survey (National Basic Research Program of China, NBRPC) in the south of the Yellow Sea from 2006 to 2012. Predictive performance metrics and Regression Error Characteristic (REC) curves computed by 10-fold cross-validation results showed that the SVM provided the best performance among the six candidate models and slightly improved the prediction accuracies compared to RF. However, the traditional methods GLM and GAM were inferior to the other four nonlinear statistical models (RTs, ANNs, RFs and SVMs). In general, RFs and SVMs should be considered as potential statistical methods for CPUE standardization. Model performance was affected by several factors, including data structure and model construction. Therefore, further research should focus these factors to improve model functionality."
901;Predicting ship fuel consumption using a combination of metocean and on-board data;"Yi Zhou a,* , Kayvan Pazouki a , Alan J. Murphy a , Zigor Uriondo b , Igor Granado c , Inaki  Quincoces c , Jose A. Fernandes-Salvador c";"Fuel Oil Consumption (FOC) accounts for a significant proportion of a vessels operating costs. The cost of fuel for a fishing vessel operation may often go up to 50% or more. Accurate forecasting FOC in voyage planning stage is essential for route optimization decision support system with the objective of fuel-saving, which is difficult because the future state of the vessel and its power and machinery systems for fuel modelling are not available during route planning stage. Moreover, the state of the environment conditions and its impact on vessel performance should be considered. In this paper, machine learning approaches were applied to predict FOC from plannable in-situ variables and modelled speed through water. The latter is estimated from speed over ground and environmental variables in this work, whose prediction is also critical for decision support systems to avoid collisions. By applying the proposed methodology, the final selected Random Forest models can achieve high mean accuracies (over 92%) in predicting fuel consumption on unseen future data."

Shipley h , Trevor Bacon d , Jeff R. Kneebone a , John W. Mandelman a";"Animal behavior varies in response to capture between/within species and fisheries, and its expression may contribute to incidental mortality when behaviors result in physiological ramifications that cannot be resolved. However, this relationship between capture behavior and animal health is poorly understood, and it remains a logistical challenge to evaluate behavior during capture. We describe an experimental technique that characterizes and quantifies capture behavior in hook-and-line fisheries. This technique includes (1) simultaneously monitoring the behavioral response to capture with accelerometers and cameras, (2) characterizing behavior from video footage and linking discrete behaviors to acceleration data, and (3) predicting behavior based solely on acceleration data using an ensemble of supervised classification methods. We captured oceanic whitetip sharks, Carcharhinus longimanus, with experimental (hook-and-line) gear to test these techniques (n = 38 capture events), with capture durations ranging from 4 to 68 min. In all, 145,589 tri-axial acceleration observations were collected across these events, including simultaneous video footage (six hours total) from 10 capture events. Three discrete capture behaviors were characterized: steady swimming, a high-energy response consisting of thrashing and burst swimming, and a loss of body orientation while hanging motionless from the gear. The latter two behaviors can lead to physiological stress if exhibited for prolonged periods. Our trained ensemble of supervised classification methods successfully predicted behaviors from acceleration data with up to 95.2% accuracy. This technique provides a better understanding of the behavioral response to hook-and-line capture and, if paired with health or fate assessments, can characterize the influence of behavior on mortality. Our technique also provides a method for predicting behavior based on acceleration data alone, which can be more feasible to collect across the spectrum of fishing conditions and practices within a fishery. Such information will assist in understanding how species respond to capture on hook-and-line gear and in the formulation of species- and fishery-specific strategies for mitigating mortality."
903;Hybrid machine learning techniques in the management of harmful algal blooms impact;"Andres Molares-Ulloa a,* , Daniel Rivero a,b , Jess Gil Ruiz c , Enrique Fernandez-Blanco a,b , Luis de-la-Fuente-Valentn c";"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are episodes of high concentrations of algae that are potentially toxic for human consumption. Mollusc farming can be affected by HABs because, as filter feeders, they can accumulate high concentrations of marine biotoxins in their tissues. To avoid the risk to human consumption, harvesting is prohibited when toxicity is detected. At present, the closure of production areas is based on expert knowledge and the existence of a predictive model would help when conditions are complex and sampling is not possible. Although the concentration of toxin in meat is the method most commonly used by experts in the control of shellfish production areas, it is rarely used as a target by automatic prediction models. This is largely due to the irregularity of the data due to the established sampling programs. As an alternative, the activity status of production areas has been proposed as a target variable based on whether mollusc meat has a toxicity level below or above the legal limit. This new option is the most similar to the actual functioning of the control of shellfish production areas. For this purpose, we have made a comparison between hybrid machine learning models like Neural-Network-Adding Bootstrap (BAGNET) and Discriminative Nearest Neighbor Classification (SVM-KNN) when estimating the state of production areas. The study has been carried out in several estuaries with different levels of complexity in the episodes of algal blooms to demonstrate the generalization capacity of the models in bloom detection. As a result, we could observe that, with an average recall value of 93.41% and without dropping below 90% in any of the estuaries, BAGNET outperforms the other models both in terms of results and robustness."
904;Application of a fish habitat model considering mesoscale oceanographic features in evaluating climatic impact on distribution and abundance of Pacific saury (Cololabis saira);"Qinwang Xing a,b , Haiqing Yu b , Yang Liu a,c , Jianchao Li a , Yongjun Tian a,c,* , Andrew Bakun d , Chang Cao a , Hao Tian a , Wenjia Li a";"The continuing development of appropriate environmental predictors is important to improving the performance of fish habitat models. Mesoscale oceanographic features (MOFs) such as fronts, eddies, or upwelling zones, sometimes appearing as oases in a fluid desert occupying >50 km ocean surface, have customarily been regarded as key factors driving fish distributions. However, previous algorithms quantifying oceanographic features have not provided greatly enhanced predictive power to the fish habitat models which are characterized by a low variable importance due to inadequate attention having been paid to its scale-specific aspects. Here, a new predictor representing MOFs is introduced and a reappraisal by common fish habitat models of the role of the MOFs in fish distribution within a case study on Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) in the northwestern Pacific is reported. When the new predictor with MOFs was introduced, the performances of three commonly used fish habitat models were all improved significantly (26%30%), together with the paramount importance of MOFs among all predictive variables, suggesting that MOFs may exert significant effects on Pacific saury distribution. Using the optimal model (Random Forest) selected among the three, the habitat distribution of Pacific saury in Oyashio water was then reconstructed for the period of 19932020 to explore its spatio-temporal variations and its relationship with the abundance variation. The suitable habitats (areas of reconstructed catch > 12 tons) during major fishing seasons (AugustNovember) estimated by the optimal habitat model for Pacific saury showed a clear northward shift of 0.045?/year for the period of 19932020, associated with the poleward movement of both oceanic isotherms and the Oyashio extension due to northward movement of the whole wind field in concert with global warming. The estimated annual suitable habitat area (SHA) during the early fishing seasons (JuneSeptember) showed large inter-annual variations with a peak around 2010 and a valley in 2015, and correlated significantly with the abundance index of Pacific saury, implying that the SHA can be regarded as a practical indicator of abundance. Moreover, it was also found that a marked decline in the SHA was involved in the dramatic decrease in the abundance and catch of Pacific saury after 2010, while eastward movements of SHA resulted from MOFs possibly aggravated the decrease in the catch of Japanese waters by changing its southern migration route. This study illustrates the significance of MOFs in predicting fish distribution by means of empirical habitat models and may provide new insights for understanding fish habitat variability in relation to physical-biological interactions in the ocean."
905;Evaluation of the impact of climate change on the streamflow of major pan-Arctic river basins through machine learning models;"Shuyu Zhang a , Thian Yew Gan b,* , Andrew B.G. Bush c , Gengxi Zhang d";"Under a warmer climate, streamflow from the pan-Arctic River basins exhibits increasing trends in recent years. The higher streamflow would have a large impact on the atmospheric and oceanic circulation of the Arctic, even the globe. However, due to the limited observation data and the complex hydrologic processes in the polar river basins, it is challenging to simulate and to predict the streamflow under the impact of climate change. This study applied Support Vector Regression Model (SVR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Multi-Variable Regression (MLR) model to simulate the monthly streamflow of four major pan-Arctic River basins: Mackenzie River basin, Ob River basin, Lena River basin, and Yenisei River basin. After validating the SVMs with datasets independent of the calibration experience, the SVMs were used to predict the monthly streamflow of the four large pan-Arctic river basins, under the climate projection scenarios, SSP245 and SSP585, of five CMIP6 GCMs: BCC-CSM2-MR, CAS-ESM2-0, CMCC-ESM2, FIO-ESM-2-0, and MPI-ESM1-2-HR, for 20202100. Results show that: 1) the precipitation and temperature are both projected to increase by almost five GCMs in almost river basins with larger amplitudes under SSP585 than SSP245 2) with wetter and warmer climate, the annual streamflow was projected to increase continuously over the twenty-first century for Mackenzie, Lena, and Yenisei river significantly, with larger amplitudes under SSP585 than SSP245. The Ob river does not show significant increasing trends in its annual streamflow 3) the higher annual streamflow of Lena and Yenisei river basins mainly come from the increase in summer streamflow, while for Meckanzie, the streamflow in summer and winter increases evenly. As its higher winter streamflow compenstates its lower summer streamflow, the annual streamflow of the Ob river is projected with minimal changes. In addition, the onset of spring snowmelt is also projected to occur earlier in all river basins due to warmer climate. Results of this study agree with previous findings that the Arctic streamflow is increasing, but this study also demonstrate different responses in seasonal streamflow between the river basins to warmer temperature and higher precipitation, which is largely controlled by the respectiver terrestrial environment of the river basins."
906;"Support vector machines to model presence/absence of Alburnus alburnus alborella (Teleostea, Cyprinidae) in North-Western Italy: Comparison with other machine learning techniques";"Tina Tirelli *, Marco Gamba, Daniela Pessani";"Alburnus alburnus alborella is a fish species native to northern Italy. It has suffered a very sharp decrease in population over the last 20 years due to human impact. Therefore, it was selected for reintroduction projects. In this research project, support vector machines (SVM) were tested as possible tools for building reliable models of presence/absence of the species. A system of 198 sites located along the rivers of Piedmont in North-Western Italy was investigated. At each site, 19 physical-chemical and environmental variables were measured. We verified that performances did not improve after feature selection but, instead, they slightly decreased (from Correctly Classified Instances [CCI] = 84.34 and Cohens k [k] = 0.69 to CCI = 82.81 and k = 0.66). However, feature selection is crucial in identifying the relevant features for the presence/absence of the species. We then compared SVMs performances with decision trees (DTs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) built using the same dataset. SVMs outperformed DTs (CCI = 81.39 and k = 0.63) but not ANNs (CCI = 83.03 and k = 0.66), showing that SVMs and ANNs are the best performing models, proving that their application in freshwater management is more promising than traditional and other machine-learning techniques."
907;Development of automated marine floating plastic detection system using Sentinel-2 imagery and machine learning models;"Srikanta Sannigrahi a,* , Bidroha Basu b , Arunima Sarkar Basu a , Francesco Pilla a";"The increasing level of marine plastic pollution poses severe threats to the marine ecosystem and biodiversity. Open remote sensing data and advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms could be a cost-effective solution for identifying large plastic patches across the scale. The potential application of such resources in detecting and discriminating marine floating plastics (MFP) are not fully explored. Therefore, the present study attempted to explore the full functionality of open Sentinel satellite data and ML models for detecting and classifying the MFP in Mytilene (Greece), Limassol (Cyprus), Skala Loutron, Greece, Calabria (Italy), and Beirut (Lebanon). Two ML models, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were utilized to perform the classification analysis. In-situ plastic location data was collected from the control experiments conducted in Mytilene, Greece (in 2018 and 2019), Skala Loutron, Greece (2021), and Limassol, Cyprus (2018), and the same was considered for training the models. The accuracy and performances of the trained models were further tested on unseen new data collected from Calabria, Italy and Beirut, Lebanon. Both remote sensing bands and spectral indices were used for developing the ML models. A spectral signature profile for marine plastic was created for discriminating the floating plastic from other marine debris. A newly developed index, kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI), was incorporated into the modelling to examine its contribution to model performances. Both SVM and RF were performed well in five models and test case combinations. Among the two ML models, the highest performance was measured for the RF. The inclusion of kNDVI was found effective and increased the model performances, reflected by high balanced accuracy measured for model 2 (~89% to ~100% for SVM and ~92% to ~98% for RF). An automated floating plastic detection system was developed and tested in Calabria and Beirut using the best-performed model. The trained model had detected the floating plastic for both sites with ~80%90%% accuracy. Among the six predictors, the Floating Debris Index (FDI) was the most important variable for detecting marine floating plastic. These findings collectively suggest that high-resolution remote sensing imagery and the automated ML models can be an effective alternative for the cost-effective detection of MFP. Future research will be directed toward collecting quality training data to develop robust automated models and prepare a spectral library for different plastic objects for discriminating plastic from other marine floating debris and advancing the marine plastic pollution research by taking full advantage of open-source data and technologies."
908;Interference intention classification of moving obstacles used for USV collision avoidance;"Lifei Song a, b , Hao Sun a, b , Kaikai Xu a, b , Liang Huang c, d , Houjing Chen a, b, e, *";"Unmanned Surface Vessels (USV) may interfere with ships in the same lane during navigation and may be affected by ships that actively collide or intercept the USV. Evidently, the latter poses a greater threat than the former. This paper proposes the concept of active and inactive interference. It is necessary for the USV to accurately classify the vessels intentions to conduct a suitable collision avoidance strategy. However, the existing research on collision avoidance of USV focuses on avoiding moving obstacles and rarely considers the interference intention of dynamic obstacles for USV when choosing collision avoidance strategies. This paper proposes an algorithm to recognize the interference intention of ships by combining visual classification with a Support Vector Machine (SVM). First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed to distinguish the merchant ship from a high-performance ship that actively interferes with the USV with high probability. A high-dimensional feature dataset was designed to illustrate the navigation characteristics of an obstacle, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset for obstacle classification. A modified SVM is presented to classify obstacles into active and inactive interference intention categories. Moreover, an escape algorithm based on an improved artificial potential field method is proposed for vessels with active interference. The simulation and experimental results clearly show that the USV can successfully identify the interference intention of obstacles and adopt a specific collision avoidance strategy for obstacles with active interference intentions. Using this algorithm, the USV can safely avoid obstacles with different interference intentions."
909;Identification of activity stop locations in GPS trajectories by DBSCAN-TE method combined with support vector machines;"Lei GONGa *, Toshiyuki YAMAMOTOa , Takayuki MORIKAWA";"GPS sensors on smart phones facilitate collecting and analyzing spatial-temporal information of the phone holders. Before carrying further analysis on these data, splitting continuous GPS trajectories is necessary in data processing. This paper proposes a two-step methodology (a density-based clustering algorithm in the first step and SVMs (support vector machines) in the second step) to deal with GPS data without speed or acceleration features which are usually used as key attributes in the rule-based methodologies. Entropy is used as an updated constraint to remove the erroneously identified stopping points, which leads to 1.5% improvement in the overall accuracy compared with an earlier version of the methodology. The output from the first step also make the SVMs have a better performance"
910;Spatial prediction and mapping of water quality of Owabi reservoir from satellite imageries and machine learning models;"Yvonne Yeboah Adusei a,? , Jonathan Quaye-Ballard b , Albert Amatey Adjaottor a , Alex Appiah Mensah c";"Estimation and mapping of surface water quality are vital for the planning and sustainable management of inland reservoirs. The study aimed at retrieving and mapping water quality parameters (WQPs) of Owabi Dam reservoir from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat 8 (L8) satellite data, using random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. Water samples from 45 systematic plots were analysed for pH, turbidity, alkalinity, total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen. The performances of all three models were compared in terms of adjusted coefficient of determination (R2 .adj), and the root mean square error (RMSE) using repeated k-fold cross-validation procedure. To determine the status of water quality, pixel-level predictions were used to compute model-assisted estimates of WQPs and compared with reference values from the World Health Organization. Generally, all three models produced more accurate results for S2 compared to L8. On average, the inter-sensor relative efficiency showed that S2 outperformed L8 by 67% in retrieving WQPs of the Owabi Dam reservoir. S2 gave the highest accuracy for RF (R2 .adj = 9599%, RMSE = 0.023.03) and least for MLR (R2 .adj = 559 1%, RMSE = 0.033.14). Compared to RF, SVM showed similar results for S2 but with slightly higher RMSEs (0.033.99). The estimated pH (7.06), total dissolved solids (39.19 mg/L) and alkalinity (179.60 mg/L) were within acceptable limits, except for turbidity (33.49 mg/L) which exceeded the reference thresholds. The S2 and RF models are recommended for the monitoring of surface water quality of the Owabi Dam reservoir."
911;A comparison of multi-class support vector machine and classification tree methods for hydroacoustic classification of fish-schools in Chile;"H. Robothama,*, J. Castillo b,1, P. Boscha,2, J. Perez-Kallens a,3";"The purpose of this study was to compare the results of the multi-class support vector machines (SVM) classification method to those of the classification tree (CART) method for automatic classification of fish schools. The discrimination study was done using descriptors of morphology, bathymetry, energy, and space positions for schools of three species anchovy (Engraulis ringens), common sardine (Strangomera bentincki), and jack mackerel(Trachurus murphyi)from acoustic data in southern-central Chile. The classification rate averages were 86.8% with classification trees and 89.5% with SVM. The levels of importance of the descriptors presented by the two methods are not fully concordant (Kendalls rank coefficient of concordance is 0.77). However, the two methods agree on the groups of descriptors considered as effective for classification. The bottom depth descriptor was the most important for classification trees, while the school-altitude index was the most important for SVM. This highlights the importance of the bathymetric and positional descriptors in the classification of species compared to energetic and morphometric descriptors. Advantages and disadvantage of the methods are presented. Classification trees have the advantages over SVM of being easier to implement and interpret, but have a lesser performance. One major problem with trees is their high degree of variance. Because each classification method has its own performance, limitations and advantages, a good practice is to use two or more classifiers."
912;Water eutrophication assessment relied on various machine learning techniques: A case study in the Englishmen Lake (Northern Spain);"P.J. Garca Nietoa,? , E. Garca-Gonzaloa , J.R. Alonso Fernndezb , C. Daz Muizb";"Algal atypical productivity, also called eutrophication, is a process where the phosphorus content in the water, together with aquatic flora, increases, causing high Chlorophyll levels and affecting the water quality and its possible applications. Therefore, it is important to be able to anticipate such circumstance to avoid subsequent hazards. In this paper, a model that estimates the conditions where an abnormal growth of algae in reservoirs and lakes takes place is built. This method combines artificial bee colony and support vector machines algorithms to predict the eutrophication taking into account physical-chemical and biological data sampled in the Englishmen Lake and posterior analysis in a laboratory. The support vector machines parameters are tuned by means of the artificial bee colony algorithm, improving the accuracy of the procedure. For comparison sake, two other methods have been used to construct additional models, the M5 model tree and multilayer perceptron network. Two objectives are covered by this study: the forecasting of the algal proliferation by means of the model and, the ranking of the relative importance of the independent variables. Indeed, coefficients of determination of 0.92 for the Chlorophyll and 0.90 for the Total phosphorus concentrations were obtained using this hybrid method that optimizes the regression parameters. Furthermore, the results obtained with M5 model tree and multilayer perceptron network techniques were clearly worse. Finally, conclusions of this work are drawn in the final section."
913;Detecting stranded macro-litter categories on drone orthophoto by a multi-class Neural Network;"Luis Pinto a , Umberto Andriolo b,* , Gil Gonalves b,c";"The use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS, aka drones) images for mapping macro-litter in the environment have been exponentially increasing in the recent years. In this work, we developed a multi-class Neural Network (NN) to automatically identify stranded plastic litter categories on an UAS-derived orthophoto. The best results were assessed for items that did not have substantial intra-class colour variability, such as octopus pots and fishing ropes (F-score = 61%, on average). Instead, performance was poor (37%) for plastic bottles and fragments, due to their changing intra-class colours. On average, the performance improved 24% when the binary detection (litter/non-litter, F-Score = 73%) was considered, however this approach did not discriminate the litter categories. This work gives a new perspective for the automated litter detection on drone images, suggesting that colourbased approach can be used to improve the categorization of stranded litter on UAS orthophoto."
914;Building consistent time series night-time light data from average DMSP/ OLS images for indicating human activities in a large-scale oceanic area;"Rongyong Huang a,b,1 , Wenqian Wu a,1 , Kefu Yu a,b,";"Human activities in the ocean have never been chronically and continuously investigated on a large scale. Nighttime light (NTL) images collected by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) have been used as a proxy for monitoring the distribution and intensity of some human activities in the ocean from 1992 to 2013. However, systematic radiometric biases exist among the average visible-light DMSP/OLS NTL images (DMSPavg) derived from different satellites. Moreover, the high randomness of fishing vessel locations and the large amount of noise impede the intercalibration of DMSPavg. To address these issues, this study has developed a method for generating a series of consistent NTL images from 1992 to 2013 for a largescale oceanic area. A composite image was first constructed by combining the original DMSPavg, median, and standard deviation filter images derived from the DMSPavg, and a bathymetry image. Thereafter, Random Forest (RF) algorithm was employed to classify the composite image into effective and noisy pixels. Finally, a stepwise intercalibration method was adopted to reduce the systematic radiometric biases in the denoised images. The experimental results showed that RF had an overall accuracy of 96% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.775. Furthermore, the intercalibration was shown to significantly reduce the systematic radiometric biases owing to the noises being effectively discarded by the RF. Specifically, the Sum Normalized Different Index (SNDI) of the images intercalibrated by the proposed method can reach 0.61, which is 68.2% less than that of the original DMSPavg. In addition, the correlation coefficients between the intercalibrated DMSPavg and fishery catches in the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Japan and Malaysia can reach 0.949 and 0.901, respectively, which are higher than other values, such as the one intercalibrated using the Pseudo-Invariant Features (PIFs) method. In summary, the proposed method has been proven to be effective and feasible for generating consistent time-series NTL data for a large-scale oceanic area, and the derived Total Light Index (TLI) is an effective indicator of ocean fishery activities for ocean ecosystem research and related applications."
915;Forecasting the ongoing invasion of Lagocephalus sceleratus in the Mediterranean Sea;"Gianpaolo Coroa,? , Luis Gonzalez Vilasc , Chiara Magliozzid , Anton Ellenbroekb , Paolo Scarponia , Pasquale Paganoa";"Invasive species from the Suez Canal, also named Lessepsian species, often have an ecological and financial impact on marine life, fisheries, human well-being and health in the Mediterranean Sea. Among these, the silvercheeked toad-fish Lagocephalus sceleratus (Gmelin, 1789) has rapidly colonised the eastern Mediterranean basin and is currently moving westwards. This pufferfish has a highly opportunistic behaviour, it attacks fish captured in nets and lines and seriously damages fishing gears and catch. It is a highly-toxic species with no immediate economic value for the Mediterranean market, although it currently represents 4% of the weight of the total artisanal catches. Consequently, the possible effects on Mediterranean fisheries and health require to enhance our understanding about the future geographical distribution of this pufferfish in the whole basin. In this paper, an overall habitat suitability map and an effective geographical spread map for L. sceleratus at Mediterranean scale are produced by using cloud computing-based algorithms to merge seven machine learning approaches. Further, the potential impact of the species is estimated for several Mediterranean Sea subdivisions: The major fishing areas of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Economic Exclusive Zones, and the subdivisions of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean Sea. Our results suggest that without an intervention, L. sceleratus will continue its rapid spread and will likely have a high impact on fisheries. The presented method is generic and can be applied to other invasive species. It is based on an Open Science approach and all processes are freely available as Web services."
916;DeepData: Machine learning in the marine ecosystems;"Leonor Oliveira e Silva, Magda Resende, Helena Galhardas, Vasco Manquinho, Ins Lynce";"Based on environmental and species monitoring data, Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) tries to build a model to predict the distribution of a species across a geographic area. These models can then be used to manage the activities in the area in order to prevent negative economic and environmental impacts. In marine ecosystems, SDM can be used to regulate fishing practices or manage protected areas. This paper presents DeepData, a new no-code web-based machine learning platform to facilitate the work of marine biologists with SDM. The DeepData tool enables to automate SDM, by automating the creation and validation of the model by marine biologists. Biologists mostly use probabilistic algorithms, such as maximum entropy, generalized linear models and generalized additive models. The DeepData tool also allows the use of machine learning algorithms, such as classification and regression trees, random forests and support vector machines. Moreover, besides the usage of machine learning algorithms, other steps in SDM, such as data preparation and model evaluation, are also discussed in the paper. Furthermore, a concrete explanation of the use of the DeepData tool is presented, as well as the details of implementation and evaluation."

918;Acoustic identification of small pelagic fish species in Chile using support vector machines and neural networks;"Hugo Robothama,* , Paul Boscha , Juan Carlos Gutirrez-Estrada b, Jorge Castilloc , Inmaculada Pulido-Calvo b";"Hydroacoustic techniques are a valuable tool for the stock assessments of many fish species. Nonetheless, such techniques are limited by problems of species identification. Several methods and techniques have been used in addressing the problem of acoustic identification species. In this paper, schools of anchovy, common sardine, and jack mackerel were classified using support vector machines (SVMs) and two types of supervised artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptron, MLP and probabilistic neural networks, PNNs) during acoustic surveys in south-central Chile. Classification was done using a set of descriptors for the schools extracted from the acoustic records. The problem was approached through two multi-class SVMs classifiers: one-species-against-one (1-vs-1) and one-species-against-the-Rest (1- vs-R). Multi-class classifications showed that the MLP neural network and SVM approach performed better than the PNN. The classification rates averaged 79.4% with PNN and 89.5% with MLP and SVM."
919;Real-time eutrophication status evaluation of coastal waters using support vector machine with grid search algorithm;"Xianyu Kong, Yuyan Sun, Rongguo Su? , Xiaoyong Shi";"The development of techniques for real-time monitoring of the eutrophication status of coastal waters is of great importance for realizing potential cost savings in coastal monitoring programs and providing timely advice for marine health management. In this study, a GS optimized SVM was proposed to model relationships between 6 easily measured parameters (DO, Chl-a, C1, C2, C3 and C4) and the TRIX index for rapidly assessing marine eutrophication states of coastal waters. The good predictive performance of the developed method was indicated by the R2 between the measured and predicted values (0.92 for the training dataset and 0.91 for the validation dataset) at a 95% confidence level. The classification accuracy of the eutrophication status was 86.5% for the training dataset and 85.6% for the validation dataset. The results indicated that it is feasible to develop an SVM technique for timely evaluation of the eutrophication status by easily measured parameters."
920;Curvelet transform based feature extraction and selection for multimedia event classification;"Kaavya Kanagaraj, G.G. Lakshmi Priya";"Multimedia event classification has been one of the major endeavors in video event analysis. For event identification, feature extraction plays a critical role, merely distinguishing the right features becomes a challenging job. So, in this paper, feature extraction and selection for video event detection are proposed. For video event detection or classification, identification of object structure and its motion are a basic needs. So, for object detection, curvelet features are considered, due to its high directional selectivity and high anisotropic properties. Next, an algorithm for Shot Boundary Detection (SBD) called Motion based SBD (MSBD) is proposed to identify the shot boundaries. Also, to make the users to access the queried event in less time, an algorithm for representing few representative frames containing whole video content is proposed. To make an event search efficient, object-based features from dominant features are extracted and to enhance the features much more efficient and dominant, feature selection is performed using the ranking method. Lastly, an SVM classifier with RBF kernel is used for event classification. The proposed work is experimented using Columbia Consumer Video (CCV) dataset and evaluated using mean Average Precision (mAP) and find that, it outperforms various other existing methods"
921;Industrial intelligence in the care of workers mental health: A review of status and challenges;"Carlos Goetz * , Rodrigo Bavaresco, Rafael Kunst, Jorge Barbosa";"Mental health is a current concern because people worldwide have been committed to disorders that impair lives as a whole, affecting emotional states, behaviors, and body responses. These disorders decrease workers productivity, impact industries economically, and cause serious psycho-physical conditions. However, technological advances have leveraged the industry to a novel phase where digitalization and automation provide a new reality. Hence, this industrial transformation may contribute to assists human beings in the workplace with a focus on mental health. This article presents a systematic literature review to investigate studies regarding technologies employed in the care of workers mental health and the industrial role in this scenario. Three general, three focused, and three descriptive questions highlight the academic progress of industrial concern on mental health, implemented systems and cases, and research challenges. As a result, the review discussed 31 studies, extracted from an initial corpus of 25269, ranging from January 2010 to November 2020. The studies approached stress as the most frequent mental issue in the industry and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the most used machine learning algorithm, where biomarkers presented the primary data extractors to deal with this theme. Moreover, information fusion methods improved the accuracy of specific cases. However, a growing interest in mental health care has emerged only in recent years, and several challenges require efforts before applying systems in real industrial environments."
922;Integration of classifiers analysis and hyperspectral imaging for rapid discrimination of fresh from cold-stored and frozen-thawed fish fillets;"Jun-Hu Cheng a , Da-Wen Sun a,b,? , Hong-Bin Pu a , Xinghai Chen c , Yelin Liu c , Hong Zhang d , Jiang-Lin Li a";"The investigation of visible and near infrared hyperspectral imaging (4001000 nm) coupled with classifiers and spectral pre-processing techniques was conducted to discriminate fresh from cold-stored (4 C for 7 days) and frozen-thawed (20 C and 40 C for 30 days) grass carp fish fillets. Four classifiers with four spectral pretreatment methods were applied to establish the classification models. Compared with the original models established using the full wavelengths, the classification models with three classifiers of soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) in tandem with the first derivative pretreatment showed the best classification performance and the highest correct classification rate (CCR) of 94.29%. In addition, in order to reduce the high dimensionality of hyperspectral images, seven optimal wavelengths were selected by successive projections algorithm (SPA) and used to simplify the classification models. The simplified model obtained by the LS-SVM classifier coupled with the first derivative pre-processing method also presented good prediction accuracy with the CCR of 91.43%. The results demonstrated that the integration of hyperspectral imaging and classifiers analysis had a great potential for on-line detection and was feasible to rapidly and non-invasively discriminate fresh and frozen-thawed fish fillets"
923;Integrating remote sensing with swarm intelligence and artificial intelligence for modelling wetland habitat vulnerability in pursuance of damming;"Rumki Khatun, Swapan Talukdar * , Swades Pal * , Tamal Kanti Saha, Susanta Mahato, Sandipta Debanshi, Indrajit Mandal";"The current study aimed to investigate the vulnerability state of wetland habitat as a result of damming. Wetland habitat vulnerability state (WHVS) models for pre and post-dam periods were built to investigate the impact, and the difference was assessed. Sixteen hydrological, land composition and water quality parameters were used for modelling WHVS. Swarm intelligence optimised machine learning algorithms such as SVM (Support Vector Machine), ANN (Artificial Neural Network), bagging, radial basis (RBF) and M5P model tree were developed. The models efficiency was evaluated using statistical methods such as the Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. According to the machine learning models, 8.1314.58% of the area in the wetland fringe area, small patches, and edges was under the very high vulnerable wetland habitat status in the pre-dam period. During the post-dam period, the region covered by fringes and small and medium-core wetlands increased to 21.2350.58%. The PSO-RBF model was found to be the best representative model. This study provides a large database of wetland habitat conditions, which could aid policymakers in developing wetland conservation and restoration plans."
924;Healthy marine diesel engine threshold characterisation with probability density functions and ANNs;"Joseba Castresana a,* , Gorka Gabina a , Inaki  Quincoces a , Zigor Uriondo b";"The condition-based maintenance of marine propulsion systems is attracting increasing interest in safety-related, financial, and environmental terms. Many researchers have studied different marine diesel engine models and fault identification techniques. However, the thresholds between a healthy and a faulty engine have not been thoroughly analysed. Thus, this study aims to determine healthy engine threshold values for multiple parameters of a marine diesel engine. To this end, an operative commercial fishing vessel was considered, and multiple engine performance variables were measured through 2020 and the first half of 2021, totalling 5181 operating hours of the main engine without any fault occurrence. Preliminary correlation and relative deviation studies suggested the analysis of some constant trend parameters with alternative modelling techniques. Hence, probability density functions (PDFs) were used to establish confidence intervals for such parameters with data from the entire year of 2020. The parameters with the highest correlation and deviation were alternatively modelled using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Four different ANNs were trained, validated, and tested with data from 2020, calculating the mean absolute percentage errors for all the predicted parameters. Finally, data from 2021 were used to validate both the PDF and ANN modelled parameter thresholds set in 2020. For the 2021 data, the confidence interval set with the PDF showed a maximum failure rate of 1.21%. Alternatively, the ANN model parameters exhibited maximum percentage errors of 1.1%, 1.22%, and 1.95% for the engine performance, cooling, and cylinder subsystems, respectively. Finally, all the obtained thresholds were summarised, providing a good source for establishing faulty engine threshold values in future fault detection studies."

Terengganu River situated in Terengganu, Malaysia is a modern busy city known for tourism, fishing, and industry. Due to that, it has increased risk of water pollution exposure. Therefore, this paper proposes unsupervised ML include Autoencoder and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for clustering water pollution area along the Terengganu River. Then, uses Silhouette analysis to assess the total of optimum clusters in a dataset. Next, applies Adjusted Rank Index (ARI) to discover the finest comparing within original data with Autoencoder and SOM. Lastly, applies Elbow method to double verify the most excellent clusters for each clustering algorithm. Lastly, lists of polluted area in each cluster are retrieved from 14 main sampling stations with 24 water quality parameters, including 405 water samples. Result shows different cluster with different water samples. Thus, offer different strategies to manage polluted area for Terengganu Ri"
926;A multi-scale feature selection approach for predicting benthic assemblages;"Shreya Nemani a,b,* , David Cote c , Benjamin Misiuk a,e , Evan Edinger b , Julia Mackin-McLaughlin a,b , Adam Templeton a , John Shaw d , Katleen Robert a,b";"Seafloor habitat maps are an important management tool used to delineate distinct regions of the seabed based on their biophysical properties. Spatially continuous bathymetry and backscatter-derived terrain features are commonly used as proxies for environmental conditions and processes that affect species distributions. Multiscale approaches are increasingly applied to assess the relevant scales at which species co-occur. As the optimal scale(s) may be unknown, features can be calculated at multiple successive scales, yet this results in numerous highly correlated features that may negatively impact model interpretability. To address this increased dimensionality, feature selection approaches can be used to identify the most relevant features. Here, filter and wrapper approaches are assessed to select features from a highly dimensional multi-scale dataset. Terrain features describing the seabed were calculated across ten scales at two coastal sites in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, Canada. Five species assemblages were identified using ground-truth underwater video sampling. Features predicting the presence of assemblages were assessed using the two selection methods, and the set of chosen features was modelled using three machine learning algorithms: extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). The XGB model with features selected by scale-factor from the Boruta wrapper algorithm had the highest accuracy according to cross-validation- (61.67%, kappa 0.49). Bathymetry and terrain attributes were the most important predictors of assemblage occurrence across various analysis scales encompassing both broader and fine-scale variability of the seabed. The proposed feature reduction and selection approach improved the overall accuracy of predictions, and the resulting biological complexity captured in our habitat maps established baseline data for an ecologically significant coastal region."

Boothb , Bavo De Wittec , Gert Everaert a , Jesus Gago d, Francois Galgani e , Kobus Langedocka , Amy Lusher f , Thomas Maes g , Hans Pirlet a , Josie Russell h, Christopher K. Phami";"Plastic litter has been widely documented in our oceans, leading to growing worldwide concerns regarding its potential impact on the marine environment. A large proportion of this plastic accumulates at the bottom of the ocean, resulting in a need to monitor and quantify seafloor litter. Seafloor litter monitoring is mostly performed using benthic beam trawls, which have several limitations and environmental implications. New innovative ways to document and address seafloor litter are therefore necessary and requested by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14.1.1b), the Oslo Paris Convention (OSPAR) and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). This systematic review gives an overview of the state-ofthe-art of 14 current underwater technologies that are eligible for future in situ detection of plastic litter on the seafloor based on 101 publications. A set of objectives and a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale were used to benchmark the technologies and revealed that the most suitable system is often very scenario-specific and, therefore, demands investments in more than one specific group of technologies. A decision tool was established to determine the most suitable technique for a range of different situations. This review indicates that most of these technologies are currently at low-middle TRLs, requiring several more development, testing and commercialization steps before they can be applied effectively in marine field conditions. However, these technologies, alone or in combination, have the potential to contribute to the establishment of more robust global environmental indicators and monitoring programs for plastic pollution."

Waldend , Vera L. Miguisc , Nuno B. Ferreirae , Miguel B. Gasparf,g";"This paper develops a decision support tool that can help fishery authorities to forecast bivalve landings for the dredge fleet accounting for several contextual conditions. These include weather conditions, phytotoxins episodes, stock-biomass indicators per species and tourism levels. Vessel characteristics and fishing effort are also taken into account for the estimation of landings. The relationship between these factors and monthly quantities landed per vessel is explored using multiple linear regression models and data mining techniques (random forests, support vector machines and neural networks). The models are specified for different regions in the Portugal mainland (Northwest, Southwest and South) using six years of data 20102015). Results showed that the impact of the contextual factors varies between regions and also depends on the vessels target species. The data mining techniques, namely the random forests, proved to be a robust decision support tool in this context, outperforming the predictive performance of the most popular technique used in this context, i.e. linear regression."
929;Identification of land cover/land use changes in the greater area of the Preveza peninsula in Greece using Landsat satellite data;"Stavros Kolios*, Chrysostomos D. Stylios";"This study investigates the Land Use & Land Cover (LULC) changes in a coastal area of the southwest part of Epirus region, called Preveza, situated in North-western Greece. Remote sensing imagery coming from the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) sensor on board at the Landsat 7 satellite platform is used for this purpose. More specifically, we identified LULC changes in this environmentally sensitive coastal area, using Landsat image scenes for the dates of June 19th, 2000 and July 22nd, 2009. During this period, there was an increasing tourist activity and a high growth in the construction sector of the study area. The land-use changes were identified, examining several vegetation indices and band combinations, along with the implementation of different well-known classification techniques. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Brightness Index (BI) have proved to be the most suitable indices to successfully identify discrete land surface classes for this study area. Regarding the classifiers, a series of traditional and modern algorithms were tested. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) gave improved results in comparison to other more traditional classification techniques. The best overall accuracy for the study area was achieved with the SVM classifier and reached 96.25% and 97.15% on the dates of June 19th, 2000 and July 22nd, 2009 respectively. The classification results depicted notable urbanization, small deforestation and important LULC changes in the agriculture sector, indicating a rapid coastal environment change in the region of interest."
930;Vertical migration patterns linked to body and environmental temperatures in chub mackerel;"Tohya Yasuda a,* , Junji Kinoshita a , Yohei Niino a,1 , Junichi Okuyama b";"Fishes in the genus Scomber are currently one of the most abundant, economically important, and widely distributed fishes in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. This study recorded the depth, peritoneal and environmental temperature of the chub mackerel Scomber japonicus using an electronic tag. The 176 tagged mackerel were released from Tsushima Strait, Japan. A total of 1,075 days of data from November to August were obtained from seven individuals. Mackerel extensively used the epipelagic zone, and ranges of depth and environmental temperature during the overall recording period were 0.5213 m and 3.429.1 ?C, respectively. The mean depth during the day was deeper than that observed during the night in the foraging season. This vertical distribution pattern of the mackerel may overlap with that of prey organisms. We also observed a unique short-term vertical migration of mackerel during the foraging season. When the mackerel repeated the short-term vertical migrations, ranges of peritoneal temperature (13.915.0 ?C) were narrower than environmental temperature (7.916.5 ?C). This behavior allowed the mackerel to use physiologically unsuitable thermal layers, while avoiding overcooling of body temperature. However, these vertical migration patterns broke down in the spawning season. Behavioral decisions of diel vertical migration in chub mackerel may be affected by body condition of individual fish such as maturation states. Quantifying vertical migrations of Scomber species occupying intermediate trophic levels is important when considering conservation strategies of more than simply fisheries stock but also that of marine ecosystems."
931;Applications of Remote Sensing in Satellite Oceanography: A Review;"Gayathri K Devia *, Ganasri B Pa , Dwarakish G Sa";"Remote sensing has got wide range of applications in the field of coastal engineering, including estimation of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll content, suspended sediment concentration, yellow substance concentration, wave characteristics, potential fishing zone (PFZ) and so on. Various satellite remote sensing data has provided rea data which can be used to monitor coastal resources. The present paper gives an overview of some of the applications of remote sensing in the field of satellite oceanography. From the present review, it can be conclude that, even though IR and microwave radiometers can be used for measuring temperatures at different depths in oceans, better choice is to use microwave data as it has got the advantage of penetrating through clouds and also it gives a clear view in all weather conditions except rain. Band ratio approach can be used for identifying different water quality parameters. In recent past, satellite remote sensing has become an ideal tool for identifying Potential fishing zone (PFZ)."
932;"Land use mapping using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series in a heterogeneous landscape in Niger, Sahel";"Dario Schulz a,b , He Yin c , Bernhard Tischbein a , Sarah Verleysdonk a , Rabani Adamou d , Navneet Kumar a,";"Land use maps describe the spatial distribution of natural resources, cultural landscapes, and human settlements, serving as an important planning tool for decision makers. In the Sahel area, such information is valuable for risk management and mitigation in challenging sectors like food security, flood control, and urban planning. Due to its uniform quality across large areas in regular time steps, remote sensing imageries are essential input for producing land use maps. However, spatially and temporally heterogeneous landscapes in Sahel make classification of landscape features difficult. Our overall goal is to create an accurate, high resolution land use map covering Niamey, the capital of Niger and its surroundings which represents the unique landscape features in the Sahel using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 archives. We assessed the performance of three commonly used classifiers (i.e. Maximum Likelihood (ML), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)) for land use classification. To understand the utility of different features from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery for classification, we performed feature selection and compared mapping accuracies with and without feature selection. To leverage the strength of each classifier, we developed a classifier ensemble (CE) map based on the mapping accuracy of each land use class and each classifier. The results of this study showed that the performance of individual classifiers depends on feature selection method and accuracies can be improved by combining different classifiers. The ensemble map had an overall accuracy of 72  3.9% and it was found superior in terms of accuracy particularly with respect to built-up areas compared to the existing global land cover products in the study area. Our classification scheme also better characterized the regional environment in the Sahel. For example, we mapped rice and bare rocks that have important regional implication, which are not included in the existing products. Overall, our approach highlights the potentiality of combining multi-modal imageries and multiple classifiers for mapping a heterogenous environment such as the Sahel with high spatial resolution."
933;Mapping coastal marine ecosystems of the National Park of Banc dArguin (PNBA) in Mauritania using Sentinel-2 imagery;"A. Pottier a,b,* , T. Catry b , E. Tregarot c , J.-P. Marechal d , V. Fayad e , G. David b , M. Sidi Cheikh f , P. Failler c";"Coastal marine ecosystems ensure fundamental hydro-ecological functions and support high levels of biodiversity, besides being an important resource for local populations. These biocenosis have been increasingly threatened by human pressures (e.g. pollution, overfishing) along with climate change, which may have a dramatic impact on them. The National Park of Banc dArguin (PNBA) in Mauritania, one of the biggest parks in Western Africa, is a RAMSAR zone (classified by UNESCO since 1989) that plays a major role in (i) the maintenance of marine biocenosis, (ii) the protection of the ecosystems and (iii) the sequestration of carbon dioxide. Ecosystem databases and associated maps of the PNBA are out of date and limited to the southern and central parts of the park: updating is thus needed. In this paper, a supervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) was deployed using high-resolution images from Sentinel-2 combined with field data to map marine biocenosis of the PNBA. The results highlight that Sentinel-2 shows good classification accuracy for mapping marine biocenosis (>80% overall accuracy and a kappa index of 0.75), including seagrass beds. Also, the use of high-resolution sensors like SPOT-6 (1.5 m pixels) can overcome the limitations of Sentinel-2 (10 m pixels) when it comes to detecting small ecosystems distributed in patches. The use of freely-downloadable Sentinel-2 data, processed using geoinformatic freeware, make the methodology reproducible, affordable and easily transferable to local actors of biodiversity conservation for long term usage."
934;Identification of the farm origin of salmon by fatty acid and HR 13C NMR profiling;"I. Martinez a,b,*, I.B. Standal a,c, D.E. Axelson a , B. Finstad d , M. Aursand a,c";"Lipid analyses by gas chromatography (GC) and by high resolution (HR) 13C NMR combined with chemometrics were used to identify wild and farmed Atlantic salmon and the farm origin of farmed salmon. Reference samples were 59 specimens from four different farms in the Hardangerfjord (Norway) and the test fish were 17 free-living fish, caught in the same fjord. Four free-living fish were identified as wild by their fatty acids profile, n3/n6 ratio and by principal component analysis. To identify the farm of origin of farmed salmon, Bayesian belief networks (BBN) and support vector machines (SVM) were the best methods classifying correctly 58 (BBN and GC) and 56 (SVM and 13C NMR) of the 59 reference samples. Of the 12 free-living fish identified as farmed, four seemed to originate from farm 2 and 3 from farm 4. The rest could not be clearly attributed to any of the four farms and may originate from any of the other 26 farms located in the fjord."
935;A high-accuracy phishing website detection method based on machine learning;"Mahdi Bahaghighat a,* , Majid Ghasemi a , Figen Ozen b";"The rapid development of e-commerce, e-banking, and social networks has made phishing attack detection one of the most critical technologies in all cyber security systems. To improve the efficiency of anti-phishing techniques, we present an improved predictive model based on machine learning. The proposed method uses six different algorithms Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The experiments are based on a public dataset of 58,000 legitimate websites and 30,647 phishing ones, including 112 attributes for each sample. Our evaluations in the feature selection process show that after balancing the dataset and dropping constant features, a noticeable improvement can be achieved. We conducted our evaluation found on eight major unique scenarios. The experimental results of our phishing websites detection (PWD) method indicate remarkable performances in which each algorithm reached an accuracy of more than 93%, and the XGBoost classifier outperforms others with 99.2% overall accuracy, 99.1% precision, 99.4% recall, and 99.1% specificity. In addition, the study achieved optimal run-time of about 1500 ms for the XGBoost algorithm without dimension reduction while using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces it down to just 869 ms. As a result, the proposed approach would be practical in both offline and real-time applications."
936;An in-depth automated approach for fish disease recognition;"Md. Jueal Mia a,? , Rafat Bin Mahmud a , Md. Safein Sadad a , Hafiz Al Asad a , Rafat Hossain b";"Fish plays a significant role in food and nutritional security in our country as well as the whole world. Owing to this reason, it becomes essential to increase the production of fish. But it is diminishing due to numerous diseases which can deteriorate the national economy. It is a fact that there is no single effective research work that has been done in regards to fish disease due to a lack of data and a high level of expertise. Consequently, our aim is to recognize the fish disease effectively that can help the remote farmers who need proper support for fish farming. Recognition of disease-attacked fish at an early stage can help us take necessary steps to prevent from spreading of the disease. In this work, we have performed an in-depth analysis of expert systems that can continue with an image captured with the help of smartphones and identifies the disease. Two set of features is selected then a segmentation algorithm is employed to detect the disease attacked portion from the disease-free portion. Furthermore, eight prominent classification algorithms are implemented accordingly to measure the performance using performance evaluation matrices. The achieved accuracy of Random forest 88.87% which is promising enough."
937;"Retrieval model for total nitrogen concentration based on UAV hyper spectral remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms  A case study in the Miyun Reservoir, China";"Jiang Qunou a,b,c,* , Xu Lidan a , Sun Siyang a , Wang Meilin a , Xiao Huijie a";"Monitoring the water pollution level in real time is the most critical issue for protecting the water quality of water reservoirs. Due to the restrictions on flight areas of Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV), four sensitive regions with the area of 12 km2 were first selected in this study based on the spatial distribution of total nitrogen (TN) concentration changes estimated by the Landsat remote sensing data. And then twelve machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR), Lasso Regression (Lasso), Elastic Net (EN), Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), K Neighbors Regression (KNR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Extra Trees Regression (ETR), AdaBoost Regression (ABR) and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) were compared to construct a more accurate retrieval model by using the UAV hyper spectral remote sensing and ground monitoring data. And then the TN concentration was estimated after the process of dimensionality reduction and compressed sensing denoing. Finally, spatial heterogeneity of the TN concentration was analyzed in four sensitive areas of the Miyun reservoir. The results demonstrated that among the tested algorithms the Extra Trees Regression was best suitable for the construction of a TN concentration retrieval model on the basis of UAV hyper spectral data, and its absolute squared error was 0.000065. The spatial distribution of the TN showed that the concentration was highest within the water area of the Bulaotun village and the Houbajiazhuang village, while it was relatively low for the Chao river dam and Bai river dam. Additionally, no significant differences regarding the concentrations were shown in the single UAV flight area except the Houbajia village, which indicated that the water quality in Miyun reservoir was relatively stable and changed in a small interval. These conclusions can provide scientific references for water quality monitoring and management in the water reservoir."
938;Issues with the detection and classification of microplastics in marine sediments with chemical imaging and machine learning;"Reaha Goyetche a , Leire Kortazar a,b , Jose Manuel Amigo a,c,";"Numerous studies have attempted to detect microplastic litter directly in environmental sediments via spectral imaging and powerful classification algorithms. Spectral imaging is attractive largely due to the benefits of adding a spatial element to spectral data, the relative measuring speed, and minimal sample processing. Despite this promise, important concerns related to the spatial and spectral selectivity must be considered along with the appropriateness of classification algorithms. Here we evaluate the performance of near infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) and four commonly used classification algorithms on a simple test case in which images of individual microplastics of known size on top of sand were collected. The results highlight major weak points of NIR-HSI and machine learning as applied to the detection of the microplastics, with a large proportion of false positives and negatives in most of the situations studied, and alerts the reader to important concerns about the use of this methodology."
939;FRDA: Fingerprint Region based Data Augmentation using explainable AI for FTIR based microplastics classification;"Xinyu Yan a,b , Zhi Cao c , Alan Murphy c , Yuhang Ye a , Xinwu Wang d , Yuansong Qiao a,";"Marine microplastics (MPs) contamination has become an enormous hazard to aquatic creatures and human life. For MP identification, many Machine learning (ML) based approaches have been proposed using Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). One major challenge for training MP identification models now is the imbalanced and inadequate samples in MP datasets, especially when these conditions are combined with copolymers and mixtures. To improve the ML performance in identifying MPs, data augmentation method is an effective approach. This work utilizes Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to reveal the influence of FTIR spectral regions in identifying each type of MPs. Based on the identified regions, this work proposes a Fingerprint Region based Data Augmentation (FRDA) method to generate new FTIR data to supplement MP datasets. The evaluation results show that FRDA outperforms the existing spectral data augmentation approaches."
940;A green analytical method for fish species authentication based on Raman spectroscopy;"Yaxi Hua,b,* , Shr Yun Huanga , Xiaonan Lua,c,*";"Fish mislabeling is a rampant global issue, damaging consumers economic benefits and trust in the fish industry and government authorities, as well as diminishing the efficacy of the sustainability measurement and management of fisheries. Although DNA barcoding as a gold standard method provides accurate identification of biological species of fish, this method is complicated and slow, and requires reagents and solvents. To develop a more rapid, easy-to-use, and environmentally-friendly method for fish species identification, we integrated the non-destructive Raman spectroscopy with chemometrics/machine learning for rapid and simple fish species authentication. Two Raman spectrometers (i.e., a portable Raman spectrometer and a benchtop confocal Raman spectrometer) were used and compared for their performance to identify 11 species of fish (i.e., 4 species of Salmonidae and 7 species of non-Salmonidae). Supervised chemometric/machine learning classification models were constructed based on a hierarchical classification principle to solve this 11-class identification problem. Both Raman spectrometers were able to differentiate Salmonidae from non-Salmonidae fish with close to 100% accuracy (i.e., first-hierarchical level). To further identify the fish to species level, the portable Raman spectrometer provided better accuracy (i.e., 93% and 93% accuracy for the Salmonidae group and non-Salmonidae group of fish identification, respectively) compared to the benchtop Raman spectrometer (i.e., 90% and 84% accuracy for the Salmonidae group and non-Salmonidae group of fish identification, respectively). The overall analytical time from sample to results can be completed within 5 min, much faster compared to the gold standard method. Moreover, the classification power of this Raman spectroscopy-based technique is expected to be improved with an increased spectral number of fish species and biological replicates in the Raman spectral library, as well with advanced machine learning algorithms. This rapid and reliable fish authentication method based on Raman spectroscopy will provide government laboratories and the fish industry another useful tool to routinely and frequently monitor the fish authenticity, and thus to protect consumers benefits and guarantee the efficacy of the fishery sustainability measurement and management strategies."
941;Deep residual convolutional neural network based on hybrid attention mechanism for ecological monitoring of marine fishery;"Jiangxun Liu a , Lei Zhang a , Yanfei Li b , Hui Liu a,";"Understanding the ecological environment, population abundance, and growth status of marine organisms in the marine fishery is important to promote its sustainability. However, existing manual detection methods can cause some damage to marine ecology and are difficult to meet the demand for fast and accurate detection. In addition, light, shadows, and disturbances in the marine ecosystem can affect the effectiveness of intelligent detection methods. To address these problems, a deep residual convolutional neural network (DRCNN) based on hybrid attention mechanism (HAM) is proposed to detect marine organisms. The hybrid attention mechanism obtains key information from both channel and space dimensions of the input image. And the residual module is added to the deep convolutional neural network to iteratively extract image features while avoiding error accumulation. It is demonstrated experimentally that the HAM-DRCNN model achieves 93.17% image localization accuracy with a processing speed of 20.95 frames/s. Compared with the YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, the mean average precision of species classification is 91.36%, which is an improvement of 0.93% and 9.39%, respectively. In addition, excellent results are achieved on two other benchmark datasets. The method can accurately locate and complete the classification of marine organisms in underwater images and has practical application value."
942;Current computational methods for predicting protein interactions of natural products;"Aurlien F.A. Moumbock, Jianyu Li, Pankaj Mishra, Mingjie Gao, Stefan Gnther";"Natural products (NPs) are an indispensable source of drugs and they have a better coverage of the pharmacological space than synthetic compounds, owing to their high structural diversity. The prediction of their interaction profiles with druggable protein targets remains a major challenge in modern drug discovery. Experimental (off-)target predictions of NPs are cost- and time-consuming, whereas computational methods, on the other hand, are much faster and cheaper. As a result, computational predictions are preferentially used in the first instance for NP profiling, prior to experimental validations. This review covers recent advances in computational approaches which have been developed to aid the annotation of unknown drug-target interactions (DTIs), by focusing on three broad classes, namely: ligand-based, target-based, and targetligand-based (hybrid) approaches. Computational DTI prediction methods have the potential to significantly advance the discovery and development of novel selective drugs exhibiting minimal side effects. We highlight some inherent caveats of these methods which must be overcome to enable them to realize their full potential, and a future outlook is given."

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as a functional food characterized by multi-compound and multi-target have been proven to be effective in treating asthma based on a holistic way. However, the potential molecular or systems mechanism of TCM to anti-asthma has not yet been fully elucidated. A systems pharmacology-based method combining the ADME evaluation, herb feature mapping, drug target fishing, network pharmacology, as well as pathway analysis is developed to comprehensively elucidate the potential therapeutic mechanism of asthma, exemplified by the anti-asthma herbal medicine intervention (ASHMI). Our study not only provides a comprehensive thinking for better understanding the complex action mechanism of ASHMI on asthma from a system level, but also proposed a rational novel way to facilitate the treatment of asthma."

Fraser-Miller b , Keith C. Gordon b , Valeriya Komyakova c,d , Bridie J.M. Allan a";"Plastics are ubiquitous throughout global marine ecosystems. To date, there has been limited research on the prevalence of microplastic ingestion by commercially important marine fish in the southern hemisphere, particularly in the South Pacific. Therefore, this research aimed to quantify ingested microplastics from ten commercially important fish species from southern New Zealand using microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Overall, we found evidence of microplastic ingestion in 75 % of fish, with an average of 2.5 individual particles per fish. Microplastic fibers were the most commonly ingested. The most common colored microplastics ingested were blue, black and red, and 99.68 % of plastics identified were smaller than 5 mm. Raman spectroscopy of plastics recovered from nine fish species found polyethylene and polypropylene to be the most common plastic polymers ingested. Further research is necessary to ascertain the human ecological and health risks involved when exposed to microplastics through eating plastic contaminated fish."
945;Spatio-temporal variation and seasonality of Odontocetes  foraging activity in the leeward side of the island of Hawaii;"Giacomo Giorli? , Whitlow W.L. Au";"The Kona coast of the island of Hawaii hosts many species of odontocetes. These marine mammals are top predators and their foraging activity plays an important role in the ecosystem dynamics. Three passive acoustics recorders were used to study the temporal and spatial occurrence of the foraging activity of odontocetes (excluding beaked and sperm whales) at three locations along the Kona coast of Hawaii between 2012 and 2013. Echolocation clicks were detected using the M3R1 (Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges) system, and custom-designed Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) programs were designed to analyze the detected data. A Generalized Linear Model was used to understand the influence of location and month on the foraging activity. Both location and month affected the foraging activity of Odontocetes in Hawaii. In general, the foraging activity was the highest in the north and the lowest in the south part of the study area. The model revealed that, at each location, the foraging activity tended to decrease over the time of the study. A seasonality seems to be seen for the two southernmost locations. At the northernmost location the foraging activity decreased from February 2012 till 11 months later (January 2013). Odontocetes daily foraging activity was higher at night-time at all locations sampled."

Integrated with literature analysis of traditional method, CiteSpace and VOSviewer are then jointly used for the development of the knowledge network map and cluster analysis, and the knowledge of network map, research hotpots, research evolution and knowledge frontiers is obtained. It is found that there is a close cooperative relationship among journals, researchers, research institutions and countries or regions. According to the subjects and methods, the study of marine accidents can be divided into two parts: the analysis of the influential factors and accident consequences, as well as the methodology development of traditional and emerging technology. In this context, the analysis of human factors in remote-controlled ships, the prevention of accidents in Arctic waters have become research hotspots, while emerging accident analysis methods such as machine learning and big data mining also have shown powerful insights in the analysis of marine accidents. In terms of innovation, the bibliometric approach enhances the ability to handle large literature databases and conduct network analysis. Moreover, this study visualises collaborative networks, analyses evolution trends, reveals the research hotpots, and conducts a comparison and discussion of mainstream approaches in marine accident research. As a result, this study provides a theoretical basis and implementation direction for the development of maritime safety."
947;Automatic analysis of pronunciations for children with speech sound disorders;"Shiran Dudy*, Steven Bedrick, Meysam Asgari, Alexander Kain";"Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems aim to help a child learn the correct pronunciations of words. However, while there are many online commercial CAPT apps, there is no consensus among Speech Language Therapists (SLPs) or non-professionals about which CAPT systems, if any, work well. The prevailing assumption is that practicing with such programs is less reliable and thus does not provide the feedback necessary to allow children to improve their performance. The most common method for assessing pronunciation performance is the Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) technique. Our paper proposes two new GOP techniques. We have found that pronunciation models that use explicit knowledge about error pronunciation patterns can lead to more accurate classification whether a phoneme was correctly pronounced or not. We evaluate the proposed pronunciation assessment methods against a baseline state of the art GOP approach, and show that the proposed techniques lead to classification performance that is more similar to that of a human expert."
948;"Preliminary examination of influence of Chlorophyll, Total Suspended Material, and Turbidity on Satellite Derived-Bathymetry estimation in coastal turbid water";"Mohammad Ashphaq a,*,1 , Pankaj K. Srivastava b,1 , D. Mitra c,1";"The satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has been researched for almost the past five decades, but the application of SDB for operational use is still in its initial stages. The higher concentration of suspended material is a major barrier in assessing bathymetry accurately with remote sensing data. The influence of various optically active substances (OAS) needs to be quantified to develop a more robust SDB algorithm. The goal of the study is to improve the accuracy of SDB by understanding the spatial distribution of Chlorophyll (Chl), Total Suspended Material (TSM), and Turbidity in coastal water. A preliminary investigation using the numerical analysis between Landsat-7 & 8 spectral bands, OAS parameters, and bathymetry is presented in this paper. SDB has been derived using three machine learning algorithms Linear, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression. The resulting SDB residuals have been analyzed in relation to Chlorophyll, Turbidity, and TSM in coastal seawater. The study found that most of the erroneous SDB residuals and extreme values were distributed in high or medium concentrated OAS regions. The result of the study may further enhance SDB estimation accuracy by considering the influence of the above three OAS in coastal waters."

The methodology comprises satellite data extraction and preprocessing for atmospheric and water surface corrections, identifying feature importance, in-situ sample collection, training and testing of machine learning algorithms, and prediction. Six input bands are selected using feature importance algorithms from 12 original bands of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In-situ sample data that are synchronous with Sentinel-2 image capture time were obtained from a public database. These models are evaluated and compared using spider plots of different error calculations. The workflow developed in this study and the predicted spatial concentration of harmful algal blooms across the lake can be used to improve warning and advisory systems for the public and avoid exposure. The incorporation of other parameters such as water temperature, nutrient concentrations, and surface wind speed could improve the machine-learning models."
950;Damming effect on habitat quality of riparian corridor;"Swades Pal, Swapan Talukdar? , Ripan Ghosh";"Riparian corridor, a vital ecotonian ecosystem is under stress due to flow reduction and inconsistency of flow in Lower Tangon river basin across the neo tectonically active Barind tract of India and Bangladesh. But it is ill defined and its habitat quality is rarely assessed insipite of its immense socio-ecological importance. The present work intends to delineate the riparian corridor and quality assessment of the riparian habitat in reference to the hydrological alteration (HA) triggered by anthropogenic activities, mainly damming in 1989. The present work applied multi-parametric (altitude, topographic roughness, water body, forest patches) approach for delineating the riparian corridor instead of existing uni-criterion approaches for the same. Quality assessment of the habitat is done using nine surface, ecological, hydrological and anthropogenic parameters in the Arc Gis platform employing advance machine learning algorithms like Fuzzy logic (FL), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Random subspace, Dagging and Support vector machine (SVM). Total 20.63 km2 and 18.36 km2 areas respectively in pre and post-HA periods alongside the main river are identified as the riparian corridor. HA has reduced the area under the riparian corridor by 12.29% in post-HA state. Simultaneously, the quality of the riparian habitat is also deteriorated in the post-HA period. In pre-HA state, 49.05% area was under good to very good riparian habitat but it is reduced to 11.86% in post-HA state. Regularization of the flood, release of ecological flow to the downstream, renovation of tie channels between flood plain and river, restriction in agricultural invasion towards riparian forest and wetland are some of the essential steps for minimizing qualitative deterioration of riparian habitat and amelioration of the ecosystem concerned."
951;Ensemble modeling approach to predict the past and future climate suitability for two mangrove species along the coastal wetlands of peninsular India;"Pujarini Samal a , Jyoti Srivastava b,c,* , S.R. Singarasubramanian a , Pooja Nitin Saraf b,c , Bipin Charles d";"Mangroves support numerous ecosystem services and help in reducing coastal ecological risks, yet they are declining rapidly due to climate change, sea level fluctuations and human activities. It is important to understand their responses to climate and sea level changes and identify conservation target areas at spatio-temporal scales, specifically in regions of rich mangrove biodiversity. In this study, we predicted the potential impact of past (Middle Holocene, ~6000 years), current and future (2050s, 2070s RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) climate change scenarios on the two dominant species in the coastal mangrove forest wetlands of India, i.e., Rhizophora mucronata and Avicennia officinalis through an ensemble species distribution modeling approach. The ensemble modeling has been carried out by integrating eight single algorithm methods. Based on the receiver operating characteristics of area under the curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS) values the ensemble modeling has yielded the highest predictive performance for SVM for both the species and lowest by CART for R. mucronata and BIOCLIM for A. officinalis. The internal evaluation metrics of the resulting Species distribution models (SDMs) tested its robustness with AUC-0.97 and TSS-0.89 for A. officinalis and AUC-0.99 and TSS-0.90 for R. mucronata. Precipitation of Wettest Month (Bio 13) and Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter (Bio 10) was the most important variable (5467%) for the distribution of A. officinalis and Precipitation Seasonality (Bio 15) and Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (Bio 18) for R. mucronata. High precipitation and sea-level highstand during middle Holocene led to the maximum range expansion of suitable habitat for the mangrove species which is also validated in the present study by the fossil pollen datasets. Total mangrove habitat in current and future climatic scenarios decreased in 2.6 and 8.5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for 2050 and 2070 which indicates the vulnerability of the species to climate change impacts. Mangrove species are projected to shift their ranges more towards land in future experiencing a decrease in the amount of suitable coastal area available to them throughout the Indian coastline. The plausible cause for this range shift may be due to higher precipitation that is usually associated with longer period of soil inundation and because of the rise in sea level. Our findings will assist in formulating species-specific restoration plans for these keystone species in context of climate change in the Indian Subcontinent."

For example, water bodies in Ghana that are polluted amounts to 60% with most of them in deteriorating condition. However, to live a sustainable life, there is the need to follow rules of environmental management, where pollution control and advanced treatment technologies are imperative. The adoption of control strategies and advanced technologies in galamsey-affected-water basins in Ghana will help provide real-time revitalization for supply of quality water. The control strategies for water pollution management and advanced technologies would particularly help utility companies in ensuring that all Ghanaians continue to get potable, reliable, and sustainable water supplies for the current and future generations. The paper covers three key control strategies for water pollution management, vis-a-vis ` six major aspects of advanced technologies and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). AI based decision-making tools help optimize the use of various treatment technologies, such as adsorption, ion exchanges, electrokinetic processes, chemical precipitation, phytobial remediation, and membrane technology to effectively remove pollutants from affected water bodies. The paper also focuses on advantages and disadvantages of several advanced technologies, challenges on leveraging the technologies while identifying gaps, and possible technology roadmap. The review contributes to water quality issues in Ghanas Pra river basin by embracing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to address the current water pollution crisis and also ensure sustainable and secure water supply for future generations."

The aim of the present study was to develop classification models to discriminate cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) according to physical status and hydrogen peroxide treatment among fresh, frozen-thawed and frozenthawed hydrogen peroxide-treated samples. A total of 669 cuttlefish spectra were collected, under real conditions, using a portable near-infrared spectrometer (9021680 nm) operating in reflectance mode. Classification models were developed and then validated using a Support Vector Machine algorithm. Performance of the models was tested through external and hold-out validation according to their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Matthew correlation coefficient. The best performance was observed in discriminating between fresh and frozen-thawed product, in which were observed in hold-out validation 0.97 in accuracy and sensitivity, 0.96 in specificity, and 0.92 in Matthew correlation coefficient whereas, an accuracy of 0.93, sensitivity of 0.89, specificity of 0.94 and Matthew correlation coefficient of 0.83 were found in external validation. However, sample classification according to bleaching treatment showed high performance when fresh samples were excluded. Such achievements confirm the applicability of near-infrared spectroscopy to the on-site inspection of cuttlefish and the control of the fraudulent activity of replacing fresh fish with product mislabelled as such."
955;A novel beach litter analysis system based on UAV images and Convolutional Neural Networks;"Vincenzo M. Scarrica a,b , Pietro P.C. Aucelli a , Cosimo Cagnazzo c , Angelo Casolaro a , Pierpaolo Fiore a , Marco La Salandra c , Angela Rizzo c,d,* , Giovanni Scardino c,d , Giovanni Scicchitano c,d , Antonino Staiano a";"Beach litter monitoring programs play a key role in establishing effective management measures to preserve the ecological, scenic, and economic value of the coastal areas. In this study, an innovative analysis system is proposed for the automatic identification of beach debris (>2.5 cm) on aerial-photogrammetric images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) at different elevations. The workflow is based on a Convolutional Neural Network model designed for object segmentation and object recognition, and here used for instance segmentation tasks. Test cases were conducted along the Adriatic sector of the Apulia region (Italy), where the beaches have a remarkable economic importance, attracting national and international tourists, and ecological values, hosting species of high ecological value and protected areas. The results of the tests carried out in this study allowed defining 10 m as the desirable drone flight above ground. In addition, encouraging results have been obtained on the instance segmentation step, experimenting on real, synthetic and mixed data, produced by using a high-resolution blending technique. A beach litter density of 0.38 items m- 2 (on 0.66 items m- 2 ), an F-score of 0.96 and a mAP of 0.67 has been achieved on real data. A novel metric for comparing works at the state-of-theart (SOTA) in beach litter monitoring is also introduced, named density-normalized F-score. The proposed methodology represents a benchmark for the definition of a standardize procedure for the indirect evaluation and monitoring of the coastal environmental status. Besides allowing the investigation of large areas with limited human effort, the proposed system enables the evaluation of the beach litter spatial distribution and magnitude, providing useful information for the assessment of tailored beach quality indices."
956;Close-range remote sensing-based detection and identification of macroplastics on water assisted by artificial intelligence: A review;"Nina Gnann , Bjorn  Baschek , Thomas A. Ternes";"Detection and identification of macroplastic debris in aquatic environments is crucial to understand and counter the growing emergence and current developments in distribution and deposition of macroplastics. In this context, close-range remote sensing approaches revealing spatial and spectral properties of macroplastics are very beneficial. To date, field surveys and visual census approaches are broadly acknowledged methods to acquire information, but since 2018 techniques based on remote sensing and artificial intelligence are advancing. Despite their proven efficiency, speed and wide applicability, there are still obstacles to overcome, especially when looking at the availability and accessibility of data. Thus, our review summarizes state-of-the-art research about the visual recognition and identification of different sorts of macroplastics. The focus is on both data acquisition techniques and evaluation methods, including Machine Learning and Deep Learning, but resulting products and published data will also be taken into account. Our aim is to provide a critical overview and outlook in a time where this research direction is thriving fast. This study shows that most Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches are still in an infancy state regarding accuracy and detail when compared to visual monitoring, even though their results look very promising."
957;An interpretable hierarchical neural network insight for long-term water quality forecast: A study in marine ranches of Eastern China;"Dashe Li a , Xuan Zhang a,* , Yufang Yang a , Huanhai Yang a , Shue Liu b";"Accurate forecast of water quality parameters is important for water quality monitoring and water quality regulation. However, the increasingly complex marine water environment makes improving the accuracy of forecasting water quality parameters challenging. In this study, a new interpretable deep learning method for forecasting water quality parameters is proposed. This method inputs the decomposed feature data into different stacks for data processing. Several parallel structure stacks are designed to capture the features of decomposed sequences. A new attention mechanism based on the combination of recent and long-term historical data is proposed, as well as an enhanced double residual temporal convolutional network block module. In this study, dissolved oxygen data obtained from eight marine ranches along the coast of Shandong Peninsula are used. The results showed that the MAE, RMSE and MAPE of our model Forecast results were 33.48%, 33.33% and 29.26% lower than those of other algorithms on average and R2 was 6% higher on average. Our model exhibited the highest degree of fitting between the predicted value and the observed value, with the best linear fitting and the smallest error. Our work provides a valuable framework for investigating the cause and influence of water quality Forecast in marine ranches."
958;Investigation of some machine learning algorithms in fish age classification;"Semra Benzer a,* , Farid Hassanbaki Garabaghi b , Recep Benzer c , Homay Danaei Mehr b";"Marine and freshwater scientists use fish scales, vertebrae, otoliths and length-weights values to estimate fish age because reliable fish age estimation plays a very important role in fish stock management. The advances in technology and the widespread use of artificial intelligence have revealed the use of traditional observations and techniques in the fishing industry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of three disesteemed machine learning algorithms (NB, J48 DT, RF) in comparison with ANNs which has been widely used in such studies in the literature. In culmination, all three algorithms outperformed ANNs and can be considered as alternatives in case of coming across noisy and non-linear datasets. Moreover, among these three algorithms J48 DT and RF showed exceptional performance where the data for specific fish age groups werent abundant."

In terms of classification and real-time data monitoring, deep learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) each provides an efficient solution. This paper focuses on the development of an embedded system based on the principles of Deep Learning and IoT. The proposed methodology is classified into interconnected parts. The first part describes the working principles of DL with along the dataset building, model analysis and overall system architecture. A new dataset from eight different Bangladeshi fish species. In the process of DL, First, two sets of datasets have been created namely, setup-1(S1) containing original images and setup-2(S2) containing Unsharp masked photos. Then, seven conventional ImageNet pertained state-of-the-art deep learning models on both benchmarking setups: InceptionV3, Xception, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet152V2.

960;An ensemble machine learning method for microplastics identification with FTIR spectrum;"Xinyu Yan a,b , Zhi Cao c , Alan Murphy c , Yuansong Qiao a,*";"Microplastics (MPs) (size < 5 mm) marine pollution have been investigated and monitored by many researchers and found in many coasts around the world. These toxic chemicals make their way into human diet through food chain when aquatic organisms ingest MPs. Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) is a very effective method to detect MPs. To provide the automatic detecting method for MPs, Numerous studies have proposed Machine Learning (ML) based methods, such as Support Vector Machines, KNearest Neighbours, and Random Forests, for identification and classification of MPs through using the ATRFTIR data. The evaluations of these ML based methods primarily focus on the average scores across all types of MPs. However, the existing FTIR datasets are normally imbalanced. Furthermore, some MPs contain the identical functional group, and some MPs may be fouled or contaminated, which will reduce the quality of FTIR data samples (e.g. lacking of peaks or creating noises). These factors will interfere the ML classification algorithms and cause the algorithms to perform differently while identifying different MPs. Hence, this work proposes an ensemble learning algorithm to exploit the advantage of different ML algorithms based on a systematic evaluation of the existing ML based MP identification approaches. A neural network is employed to fuse the outputs of chosen ML algorithms to improve the overall metrics. The evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing single ML based approaches."

962;Automated cataloging of oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) boatwhistle calls using template matching and machine learning;DelWayne R. Bohnenstiehl *;"Oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) represent an ecologically significant species found throughout estuaries along the eastern coast of the United States. While these crevice-dwelling fish can be challenging to observe in their habitats, it is possible to infer their distribution and aspects of their behavior by recording the sounds they produce. The task of cataloging the distinctive advertisement boatwhistle sounds produced by male toadfish to attract females throughout the spring and summer is automated using a multi-step process. Candidate boatwhistles are first identified by template matching using a suite of synthetic spectrogram kernels formed to mimic the two lowest frequency harmonic tones within the boatwhistle. Candidate boatwhistle calls are identified based on the correlation between these kernels and a low-frequency spectrogram of the data. Next, frequencyreassigned spectrogram images of these candidates are formed and input into the pre-trained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network. Finally, the activations from a deep, fully connected layer within this network are extracted and passed to a one-vs-all support-vector-machine classifier, which separates boatwhistles from the larger set of candidate signals. This classifier model was trained and evaluated using a labeled dataset of over 20,000 candidate signals generated over diverse acoustic conditions within Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA. The accompanying software provides an effective and efficient tool to monitor boatwhistle calls, which may facilitate a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution, behavioral patterns, and ecological roles played by oyster toadfish."
963;Using motor vehicle crash records for injury surveillance and research in agriculture and forestry;"Eva M. Shipp a,1,? , Amber B. Trueblood b,2 , Hye-Chung Kum c,3 , Marcie Perez a,4 , Shubhangi Vasudeo a,5 , Nishita Sinha a,6 , Ashesh Pant a,7 , Lingtao Wu a,8 , Myunghoon Ko a,9";"Problem: Fatal injuries in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector (AgFF) outweigh those across all sectors in the United States. Transportation-related injuries are among the top contributors to these fatal events. However, traditional occupational injury surveillance systems may not completely capture crashes involving farm vehicles and logging trucks, specifically nonfatal events. Methods: The study aimed to develop an integrated database of AgFF-related motor-vehicle crashes for the southwest (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas) and to use these data to conduct surveillance and research. Lessons learned during the pursuit of these aims were cataloged. Activities centered around the conduct of traditional statistical and geospatial analyses of structured data fields and natural language processing of free-text crash narratives. Results: The structured crash data in each state include fields that allowed farm vehicles or equipment and logging trucks to be identified. The variable definitions and coding were not consistent across states but could be harmonized. All states recorded data fields pertaining to person, vehicle, and crash/environmental factors. Structured data supported the construction of crash severity models and geospatial analyses. Law enforcement provided additional details on crash causation in free-text narratives. Crash narratives contained sufficient text to support viable machine learning models for farm vehicle or equipment crashes, but not for logging truck narratives. Discussion: Crash records can help to fill research and surveillance gaps in AgFF in the southwest region. This supports traffic safetys evolution to the current Safe System paradigm. There is a conceptual linkage between the Safe System and Total Worker Health approaches, providing a bridge between traffic safety and occupational health. Practical Applications: Despite limitations, crash records can be an important component of injury surveillance for events involving AgFF vehicles. They also can be used to inform the selection and evaluation of traffic countermeasures and behavioral interventions"
964;Lake algal bloom monitoring via remote sensing with biomimetic and computational intelligence;"Zhibin Sun a , Ni-Bin Chang b,* , Chi-Farn Chen c , Wei Gao a,d";"Traditional supervised classifications for remote sensing-based water quality monitoring count on a set of classifiers to retrieve features and improve their prediction accuracies based on ground truth samples. However, many existing feature extraction methods in remote sensing are unable to exhibit multiple-instance nonlinear spatial pattern recognition at scales via ensemble learning. This paper designed for lake algal bloom monitoring presents intelligent feature extraction for harmonizing local and global features via tensor flow-based ensemble learning with integrated biomimetic and computational intelligence. To explore such complexity, an Integrated Biomimetic and Ensemble Learning Algorithm (IBELA) was developed to synthesize the contribution from different classifiers associated with the biomimetic philosophy of integrated bands. It leads to strengthened multiple-instance spatial pattern recognition in lake algal bloom monitoring via image fusion at the decision level. With the implementation of IBELA, a case study of a eutrophic freshwater lake, Lake Managua, for water quality monitoring leads to demonstrate six input visual senses showing different impacts on retrieving Chl-a concentrations in the dry and wet season, respectively. The input of total nitrogen from the watershed plays the most important role in water quality variations in both seasons in a watershed-based foodwater nexus. Although ultraviolet and microwave bands are important in the dry season, Secchi disk depth is critical in the wet season for water quality monitoring."
965;Recent expansion of artisanal gold mining along the Bandama River (Cote  dIvoire);"Ndeye Marame Ngom a,c,* , Modou Mbaye b,c , David Baratoux d,e , Lenka Baratoux d,e , Kouassi Ernest Ahoussi e , Jean Kan Kouame f , Gayane Faye c , El Hadji Sow a";"Recent development of small-scale gold mining activities in Cote  dIvoire is a serious threat to the environment because of deforestation, soil scrapping, pit mining, over-use of water resources and pollution of surface and ground waters by mercury, cyanides, and acids. The challenge for the governance of this activity is to resolve the tension between the desired development of a small-scale mining activity, which may benefit the local and national economy, and the impacts of this activity on the environment. The regulation of the exploration and exploitation of mining sites and the promotion of best practices was part of the National program for the rationalization of gold-panning in Cote  dIvoire. The capacity of the government to monitor the expansion of numerous mining sites disseminated all over the country is one of the key aspects for successful implementation of these policies. This study explores the potential value of computer-assisted mapping of artisanal mining sites based on Sentinel-2 imagery. The detection method, using artificial intelligence and training data sets generated during field campaigns, was inspired from a previous experience in Senegal. It was applied to a region of about 600 km2 in Central Cote  dIvoire. Annual maps of areas affected by the mining activities were produced for the period 2018  2021. The areas affected by artisanal mining activities expanded from 3.39 km2 to 8.80 km2 in December 2021, corresponding to an average growth rate of 0.24 km2 /month. The temporal and spatial resolution of the Sentinel satellite imagery proved to be useful to map and quantify the expansion rate of artisanal mining sites in Cote  dIvoire. Recommendations are made for the integration of these tools into plans for the development of small-scale mining activities in Cote  dIvoire that would be more respectful of the environment and societies."
966;Ecosystem service value assessment of a natural reserve region for strengthening protection and conservation;"Srikanta Sannigrahia,* , Suman Chakrabortib , Pawan Kumar Joshic , Saskia Keesstrad,e , Somnath Sena , Saikat Kumar Paula , Urs Kreuterf , Paul C. Suttong , Shouvik Jhah , Kinh Bac Dangi,j";"Ecosystem Services (ESs) refer to the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well-being and subsistence. Ecosystem valuation is an approach to assign monetary values to an ecosystem and its key ecosystem goods and services, generally referred to as Ecosystem Service Value (ESV). We have measured spatiotemporal ESV of 17 key ESs of Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR) in India using temporal remote sensing (RS) data (for years 1973, 1988, 2003, 2013, and 2018). These mangrove ecosystems are crucial for providing valuable supporting, regulatory, provisioning, and cultural ecosystem services. We have adopted supervised machine learning algorithms for classifying the region into different ecosystem units. Among the used machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms performed the most accurate and produced the best classification estimates with maximum kappa and an overall accuracy value. The maximum ESV (derived from both adjusted and non-adjusted units, million US$ year-1) is produced by mangrove forest, followed by the coastal estuary, cropland, inland wetland, mixed vegetation, and finally urban land. Out of all the ESs, the waste treatment (WT) service is the dominant ecosystem service of SBR. Additionally, the mangrove ecosystem was found to be the most sensitive to land use and land cover changes. The synergy and trade-offs between the ESs are closely associated with the spatial extent. Therefore, accurate estimates of ES valuation and mapping can be a robust tool for assessing the effects of poor decision making and overexploitation of natural resources on ESs."
967;A hierarchical methodology for vessel traffic flow prediction using Bayesian tensor decomposition and similarity grouping;"Wenbin Xing a,1 , Jingbo Wang a,1 , Kaiwen Zhou a,1 , Huanhuan Li b , Yan Li c,* , Zaili Yang b,";"Accurate vessel traffic flow (VTF) prediction can enhance navigation safety and economic efficiency. To address the challenge of the inherently complex and dynamic growth of the VTF time series, a new hierarchical methodology for VTF prediction is proposed. Firstly, the original VTF data is reconfigured as a three-dimensional tensor by a modified Bayesian Gaussian CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (BGCP) tensor decomposition model. Secondly, the VTF matrix (hour ? day) of each week is decomposed into high- and low-frequency matrices using a Bidimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD) model to address the non-stationary signals affecting prediction results. Thirdly, the self-similarities between VTF matrices of each week within the high-frequency tensor are utilised to rearrange the matrices as different one-dimensional time series to solve the weak mathematical regularity in the high-frequency matrix. Then, a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) model is employed to identify grouped segments with high similarities to generate more suitable high-frequency tensors. The experimental results verify that the proposed methodology outperforms the state-of-the-art VTF prediction methods using real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets collected from two areas. The methodology can potentially optimise relation operations and manage vessel traffic, benefiting stakeholders such as port authorities, ship operators, and freight forwarders."
968;Age-groups classification of Irrawaddy dolphins based on dorsal fin geometric morphological features;"Min Sheng a , Qingxuan He a , Daoping Yu b,c , Benyue Su d,e,*";"The Irrawaddy dolphin is a species at the top of the food chain, but its population is currently endangered. Hence, the critical need to take effective conservation measures for Irrawaddy dolphins, particularly in population reproduction. The age structure of Irrawaddy dolphins can be studied to understand the population reproduction status and provide reference for formulating scientific conservation measures. Unlike age estimation methods based on invasive biological tissue detection and individual biological target detection methods based on audio features or image pixel features, this paper proposes the method to extract the Irrawaddy dolphins dorsal fin geometric morphological features for classifying age-groups by using non-uniform B-spline. Firstly, this method uses non-uniform B-spline method to fit the dorsal fin edge curve of Irrawaddy dolphins. Then the curve is resolved to extract its derivatives, curvature and other features that describe its geometry morphology. Finally, the random forest (RF) was supplemented to classify Irrawaddy dolphins into juvenile, middle-aged and older. Experiments show that the method proposed in this paper could effectively classify older dolphins to an accuracy of 87.36%. The method proposed in this paper is non-invasive not only can help analyze the Irrawaddy dolphins development trajectory, understand the reproductive maturity, fecundity rates, and survival rates, but also can help understand the changes of the regional ecological environment and protect the aquatic diversity."
969;The use of machine learning in species threats and conservation analysis;"Vasco Veiga Branco a,b,* , Lus Correia b , Pedro Cardoso a";"The concepts and methodologies of machine learning are increasingly used to create semi-autonomous programmes capable of adapting to a multitude of problems and decision-making scenarios. With its potential in big data analysis, machine learning is particularly useful for tackling global conservation problems that often involve vast amounts of data and complex interactions between variables. In this systematic review, we summarise the use of machine learning methods in the study of species threats and conservation measures, and their emergent trends. Maximum entropy, Bayesian (regression or classification models) and ensemble methods (tree-based models, either bagging or boosting) have gained wide popularity in the past years and are now commonly used for multiple problems. Their relevance to modern conservation issues (and associated data types), their relatively simple implementation, and availability in a variety of software packages are the most likely factors to explain their popularity. Neural networks, decision trees, support-vector machines and evolutionary algorithms have been used in more specific situations, with some model applications showing promise in dealing with increasingly complex data and scenarios."
970;Species distribution modelling in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean: A systematic review and trends;"Lucas dos Santos Rodrigues a,b,1,* , Nicholas Winterle Daudt c,1 , Luis Gustavo Cardoso a , Paul Gerhard Kinas d , David Conesa b , Maria Grazia Pennino e";"Species distribution modelling (SDM) of marine organisms is widely developed for biogeography, ecology and management purposes. However, most studies continue to focus on the Global North, with fewer examples for the Global South. We carried out a bibliometric analysis to characterise aspects of studies conducting SDM for species in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SWAO), focusing on the type of input data, taxonomic groups studied, focus of research, methods applied, and international collaboration between countries. Studies on megafauna and fisheries resources, based on presence-only and scenopoetic input data, applying Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and generalized linear/additive models (GLM/GAM) predominate. Models applied to biogeography/current species distribution were the most common, followed by biological invasion. Brazil figures as the most prolific country publishing in SWAO, and has more collaborations with the United States of America, Europe, and South Africa than with its neighbours Uruguay and Argentina, who formed a separate cluster. Research groups based on coauthorship of the 30 most frequent authors seem to be mostly isolated, with only two research groups collaborating to each other. In addition, we fit a Binomial generalised linear model (BGLM) to explore how many predictors (layers) would be sufficient to reach an excellent modelling performance based on Area Under the Curve (AUC) values. The BGLM indicated at least 58 layers would be necessary to have a 50 % chance of achieving excellent model performance (AUC = 0.9), but we urge caution regarding this result and briefly discuss it. The literature review was used as a baseline to discuss aspects of our findings and highlight the need to increase SDM application in the SWAO and to strengthen international collaboration between Latin American countries. Finally, we provide recommendations on how researchers could approach some of the gaps we found."
971;Marine floating raft aquaculture extraction of hyperspectral remote sensing images based decision tree algorithm;"Tingting Hou a , Weiwei Sun a,* , Chao Chen b,* , Gang Yang a , Xiangchao Meng c , Jiangtao Peng d";"The accurate extraction and mapping of floating raft aquaculture (FRA) is significant to the scientific management and sustainable development of coastal zones. However, the current relevant methods rely on large sample size and complex classifiers, which have poor generalization ability and thus are not suitable for large-scale application. To address these issues, this study proposes a new hyperspectral index based on remote sensing images, namely hyperspectral index for floating raft aquaculture (HSI-FRA). Based on the analysis of the spectral information, the HSI-FRA utilizes four bands at 580 nm, 740 nm, 1040 nm, and 1290 nm, respectively, to enhance the spectral difference between the floating raft aquaculture and the seawater through band calculation, and constructs the extraction index of the floating raft aquaculture. Using the HSI-FRA, a decision tree classification process is carried out to realize the extraction of floating raft aquaculture information. The extraction accuracy in the three study areas of Dayu Bay of Zhejiang Province, Fengwei Town of Fujian Province and Chaoan Bay of Guangdong Province is 94.3%, 95.5% and 91.44%, respectively, which has Larger advantage than those of traditional methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method is simple, fast and accurate at separating the floating raft aquacultures in an offshore complex marine environment."

Big data analytics has acquired a great deal of interest from researchers to extract and use all the possible information. This paper presents an outline for predictive big data analytics to forecast and analyze some downhole problems such as pipe sticking, dog leg and pipe failure depending on several variables. Different methodologies were studied under big data, enabling the identification of the paradigm change in data storage and processing while handling vast diversified data generated in a short span of life. The evaluated data pattern sets are fed into different established predictive models and risk prediction windows to highlight future irregularities for the prevention of accidents. Finally, the game theory is used to evaluate the best predictive model to discover the optimal model for the identification of downhole problems."
973;Predicting coastal algal blooms with environmental factors by machine learning methods;"Peixuan Yu , Rui Gao * , Dezhen Zhang , Zhi-Ping Liu";"Harmful algal blooms are a major type of marine disaster that endangers the marine ecological environment and human health. Since the algal bloom is a complex nonlinear process with time characteristics, traditional statistical methods often cannot provide good predictions. In this paper, we propose a method based on machine learning with the aim to predict the occurrence of algal blooms by environmental parameters. The features related to algal bloom growth have been experimented for achieving a good prediction of algal concentrations by a combination strategy. We validate the prediction performance on two real datasets from two locations in US and China, i.e., Scripps Pier, California and Sishili Bay, Shandong, respectively. The models and feature subsets have been selected to complete the missing data and predict the phytoplankton concentration. The results demonstrate the efficiency of our method in the short-term prediction of concentrations by selecting appropriate features. The comparison studies prove the advantage of our developed machine learning method. The importance of every features for the prediction performance reveals crucial factors for the outbreak of harmful algal blooms."
974;Seagrass ecosystems along the Vietnamese coastline: Current state of research and future perspectives;"Bijeesh Kozhikkodan Veettil a , Raymond D. Ward b,c,d , Dong Doan Van e , Ngo Xuan Quang f,g,* , Pham Ngoc Hoai h";"Seagrass communities in Vietnam are important primary producers in the coastal environment and play a key role in shoreline protection as a bioshield in the country. In the past two decades, seagrass research in Vietnam has advanced in many aspects, including distribution mapping, plant genetics and biophysical characteristics, sustainable use of seagrass beds, restoration and protection of seagrass meadows, establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), and collaborative research with international institutions. In this paper, we presented a state-of-the-art review of recent seagrass research conducted in Vietnam. Despite the recent increase in the number of seagrass studies conducted in Vietnam, these coastal ecosystems continue to be poorly mapped and managed in some areas. Although a number of recent studies highlighted the use of seagrass ecosystems as a coastal bioshield in Vietnam, they have undergone degradation in recent years due to pollution, sedimentation and turbidity, eutrophication and habitat loss. Remote sensing is considered as an effective tool for mapping seagrasses in recent studies, particularly due to the ability to accurately map, model and assess the condition of some hard to access sites. Collaboration among regional authorities, NGOs and research institutions can provide an appropriate basis for understanding these complex systems at a national scale and afford an important scientific reference for supporting management and conservation decisions in Vietnam. Sustainable use of seagrass ecosystems can bring economic benefits as well as environmental protection along the coastal areas of Vietnam."
975;Mapping and classifying the seabed of the West Greenland continental shelf;"S. Gougeon a , K.M. Kemp a , M.E. Blicher b , C. Yesson a,";"Marine benthic habitats support a diversity of marine organisms that are both economically and intrinsically valuable. Our knowledge of the distribution of these habitats is largely incomplete, particularly in deeper water and at higher latitudes. The western continental shelf of Greenland is one example of a deep (more than 500 m) Arctic region with limited information available. This study uses an adaptation of the EUNIS seabed classification scheme to document benthic habitats in the region of the West Greenland shrimp trawl fishery from 60N to 72N in depths of 61e725 m. More than 2000 images collected at 224 stations between 2011 and 2015 were grouped into 7 habitat classes. A classification model was developed using environmental proxies to make habitat predictions for the entire western shelf (200e700 m below 72N). The spatial distribution of habitats correlates with temperature and latitude. Muddy sediments appear in northern and colder areas whereas sandy and rocky areas dominate in the south. Southern regions are also warmer and have stronger currents. The Mud habitat is the most widespread, covering around a third of the study area. There is a general pattern that deep channels and basins are dominated by muddy sediments, many of which are fed by glacial sedimentation and outlets from fjords, while shallow banks and shelf have a mix of more complex habitats. This first habitat classification map of the West Greenland shelf will be a useful tool for researchers, management and conservationists."
976;Vessel detection and classification from spaceborne optical images: A literature survey;"Urka Kanjira , Harm Greidanusb,? , Kritof Otirc,a";"This paper provides an overview of existing literature on vessel/ship detection and classification from optical satellite imagery. Although SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is still the leading technology for maritime monitoring, the number of studies based on optical satellite data is quickly growing. Altogether we analysed 119 papers on optical vessel detection and classification for the period from 1978 to March 2017. We start by introducing all the existing sensor systems for vessel detection, but subsequently focus only on optical imaging satellites. The article demonstrates the temporal development of optical satellite characteristics and connects this to the number and frequency of publications on vessel detection. After presenting the methods used for optical imagery-based vessel detection and classification in detail, along with the achieved detection accuracies, we also report possibilities for fusing optical data with other data sources. The studied papers show that the most common factors greatly influencing the vessel detection accuracy are the following: different weather conditions affecting sea surface characteristics, the quantity of clouds and haze, solar angle, and imaging sensor characteristics. All these factors bring great variations in the selection of the most suitable method some still continue to pose unsolved challenges. For higher relevance and wider usage, we suggest that the algorithms for detection and classification should support a variety of targets and meteorological conditions, and ideally also a variety of optical satellite sensors. At least, they should be tested on many images under different conditions. This is not usually the case in the existent literature. We also observed that many authors omit an appropriate performance quantification, which is critical for a practical assessment and a numerical comparison of the presented algorithms. Overall it can be seen that vessel monitoring from spaceborne optical images is a popular research topic and has a great operational potential in the near future due to the large amount of satellite data, much of it free and open."
977;Predicting economic resilience of territories in Italy during the COVID-19 first lockdown;"Francesco Pierri a,* , Francesco Scotti b , Giovanni Bonaccorsi b , Andrea Flori b , Fabio Pammolli b";"This paper aims to predict the economic resilience to crises of territories based on local pre-existing socioeconomic characteristics. Specifically, we consider the case of Italian municipalities during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging a large-scale dataset of cardholders performing transactions in Point-of-Sales. Based on a set of machine learning classifiers, we show that network-based measures and variables related to the social, economic, demographic and environmental dimensions are relevant predictors of the economic resilience of Italian municipalities to the crisis. In particular, we find accurate classification performance both in balanced and un-balanced scenarios, as well as in the case we restrict the analysis to specific geographical areas. Our analysis predicts that territories with larger income per capita, soil consumption, concentration of real estate activities and commuting network centrality in terms of closeness and Pagerank constitute the set of most affected areas, experiencing the strongest reduction of economic activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we provide an application of an early-warning system able to provide timely evidence to policymakers about the detrimental effects generated by natural disasters and severe crisis episodes, thus contributing to optimize public decision support systems."

The known archaeological record is therefore biased toward later sites, especially sites dating to the second millennium AD, following the expansion of Indian Ocean trading networks. Systematic archaeological investigations are required to address these biases in the known archaeological record and clarify the islands early human history, but funding limitations, logistical and time constraints in surveying large areas and a relatively small number of active field archaeologists present substantial barriers to expansive areal survey coverage. Using theoretical models derived from human behavioral ecology (i.e., ideal free distribution, optimal foraging theory) in conjunction with freely available remote sensing data, we illustrate how archaeological survey of Madagascars landscapes can be rapidly expanded, more effectively target early archaeological deposits, and address questions about the islands settlement. This study illustrates the potential for theoretically-driven satellite-based remote sensing analysis to improve our understanding of the archaeological record of the worlds fourth largest island."
979;New frontiers in the risk assessment of ship collision;"Massimiliano Marino a , Luca Cavallaro a,* , Elisa Castro a , Rosaria Ester Musumeci a , Matteo Martignoni b , Federico Roman c , Enrico Foti a";"Navigation is becoming more and more complex over the years. The increase in maritime traffic and vessel size is inducing a global escalation of ship collision accidents, with consequent losses of human lives and economic assets worth billions. This is particularly true for port basins, with maritime authorities struggling worldwide to keep up with the ever-increasing ship traffic. In this respect, the demand for advanced methods to assess and mitigate ship collision risk has never been higher. The interdependency between physical failures, weather conditions, logistics, governance and human factors requires sophisticated frameworks to effectively assist maritime authorities and navigators in decision-making. The present work reviews the most recent advancements in the risk assessment of ship collision. The article focuses on new, rising technologies, identifying the current main trends and discussing future perspectives and challenges. The review revealed a wide and diversified range of methods, including machine learning, clustering techniques, swarm intelligence algorithms and others. To frame the methods in the current literature and compare them with previous efforts, they are categorized according to literature classifications. Advancements of well-established approaches and new promising tools are discussed, considering methods that allow the inclusion of quantitative and qualitative variables in the assessment. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of a database of maritime accidents in port areas is carried out to investigate prevailing trends in both worldwide and Mediterranean Sea contexts. Results indicate that ship collision accidents constitute the majority compared with other types of accidents, especially in the Mediterranean."
980;An approach to multi-class imbalanced problem in ecology using machine learning;"Bonelwa Sidumo * , Energy Sonono, Isaac Takaidza";"Ecologists collect their data manually by visiting multiple sampling sites. Since there can be multiple species in the multiple sampling sites, manually classifying them can be a daunting task. Much work in literature has focused mostly on statistical methods for classification of single species and very few studies on classification of multiple species. In addition to looking at multiple species, we noted that classification of multiple species result in multi-class imbalanced problem. This study proposes to use machine learning approach to classify multiple species in population ecology. In particular, bagging (random forests (RF) and bagging classification trees (bagCART)) and boosting (boosting classification trees (bootCART), gradient boosting machines (GBM) and adaptive boosting classification trees (AdaBoost)) classifiers were evaluated for their performances on imbalanced multiple fish species dataset. The recall and F1-score performance metrics were used to select the best classifier for the dataset. The bagging classifiers (RF and bagCART) achieved high performances on the imbalanced dataset while the boosting classifiers (bootCART, GBM and AdaBoost) achieved lower performances on the imbalanced dataset. We found that some machine learning classifiers were sensitive to imbalanced dataset hence they require data resampling to improve their performances. After resampling, the bagging classifiers (RF and bagCART) had high performances compared to boosting classifiers (bootCART, GBM and AdaBoost). The strong performances shown by bagging classifiers (RF and bagCART) suggest that they can be used for classifying multiple species in ecological studies."
981;A Practical Visual Perception-based Species Recognition System for Non-setae Marine Microalgae;"Kun Yua,*, Chunfeng Guoa";"Marine microalgae play a vital role in maintaining the balance of global marine ecosystems and achieving carbon % goals. In this paper, 21 species of common non-setae microalgae in China Sea are taken as the research object, and a photomicrograph classification system based on visual perception is designed to automatically identify the species of microalgae according to their biological morphological characteristics. The main work includes: (1) Extract the microalgal cell targets from the photomicrographs. Aiming at non-setae microalgae, a non-interactive GrabCut method combined with salient region detection is proposed to extract single or multiple cells. First, a boundary correlation-based salient region detection algorithm is employed to localize cell regions. Then the generated saliency map is pre-segmented, and the position information in the pre-segmentation result is used to construct a rectangular window and a mask image respectively, and use them to initialize the GrabCut algorithm. Then iteratively execute GrabCut. Remove noise and smooth cell edges by extracting larger contours and median filtering, respectively. During cell extraction, similarity detection is introduced to exclude pseudo-cell regions. (2) 19 shape features such as body ratio, eccentricity, and rectangularity of microalgal cells are extracted, and the Support Vector Machine is used as a classifier to perform pattern recognition on the feature data. The experimental results show that the recognition scheme proposed in this paper has achieved a relatively ideal recognition effect on the non-setae microalgae, with a recognition accuracy rate of 81.76"
982;Mapping Mediterranean seagrasses with Sentinel-2 imagery;"Dimosthenis Traganosa,? , Peter Reinartzb";"Mediterranean seagrasses have been hailed for their numerous ecosystem services, yet they are undergoing a decline in their coverage. The major complication with resolving this tendency is the sparsity of data on their overall distribution. This study addresses the suitability of the recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite for mapping the distribution of Mediterranean seagrass meadows. A comprehensive methodology is presented which applies atmospheric and analytical water column corrections and compares the performance of three different supervised classifiers. Remote sensing of the Thermaikos Gulf, northwestern Aegean Sea (Greece, eastern Mediterranean Sea) reveals that the utilization of Support Vector Machines on water column corrected reflectances yields best accuracies. Two Mediterranean seagrasses, Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, cover a total submerged area of 1.48 km2 between depths of 1.416.5 m. With its 10-m spatial resolution and 5-day revisit frequency, Sentinel-2 imagery can mitigate the Mediterranean seagrass distribution data gap and allow better management and conservation in the future in a retrospective, time- and cost-effective fashion."

Lo Boscob,?,1 , R. Rizzoc,1 , S. Mazzolaa , G. Basilonea , R. Ferreria , S. Genovesea , M. Barraa , A. Bonannoa";"The Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union aims to exploit fish stocks at a level of Maximum Sustainable Yield by 2020 at the latest. At the Mediterranean level, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) has highlighted the importance of reversing the observed declining trend of fish stocks. In this complex context, it is important to obtain reliable biomass estimates to support scientifically sound advice for sustainable management of marine resources. This paper presents a machine learning methodology for the classification of pelagic species schools from acoustic and environmental data. In particular, the methodology was tuned for the recognition of anchovy, sardine and horse mackerel. These species have a central role in the fishing industry of Mediterranean countries and they are also of considerable importance in the trophic web because they occupy the so-called middle trophic level. The proposed methodology consists of a classifier based on an optimized two layer feed-forward neural network. Morphological, bathymetric, energetic and positional features, extracted from acoustic data, are used as input, together with other environmental data features. The classifier uses an optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer, and a feature selection strategy based on a genetic algorithm. Working on a dataset of 2565 fish schools, the proposed methodology permitted us to identify the these three fish species with an accuracy of around 95%."
984;A machine learning approach for monitoring ship safety in extreme weather events;"Andrew Rawson a,* , Mario Brito b , Zoheir Sabeur c , Long Tran-Thanh d";"Extreme weather events can result in loss of life, environmental pollution and major damage to vessels caught in their path. Many methods to characterise this risk have been proposed, however, they typically utilise deterministic thresholds of wind and wave limits which might not accurately reflect risk. To address this limitation, we investigate the potential of machine learning algorithms to quantify the relative likelihood of an incident during the US Atlantic hurricane season. By training an algorithm on vessel traffic, weather and historical casualty data, accident candidates can be identified from historic vessel tracks. Amongst the various methods tested, Support Vector Machines showed good performance with Recall at 95% and Accuracy reaching 92%. Finally, we implement the developed model using a case study of Hurricane Matthew (October 2016). Our method contributes to enhancements in maritime safety by enabling machine intelligent risk-aware ship routing and monitoring of vessel transits by Coastguard agencies."
985;Floating marine litter detection algorithms and techniques using optical remote sensing data: A review;"Konstantinos Topouzelis a,* , Dimitris Papageorgiou a , Giuseppe Suaria b , Stefano Aliani b";"Floating Marine Litter (FML) are mainly plastics or synthetic polymers that float on the sea surface after being deliberately discarded or unintentionally lost along beaches, rivers or marine environments. In recent years, much focus has been placed on locating, tracking and removing plastic items in both coastal areas and in the open ocean. The use of high-resolution multispectral satellite images for such purpose is very promising, since satellite images can systematically monitor much larger areas in comparison to the traditional in situ observations. This paper contains a literature review of the published research regarding the optical remote detection of floating marine debris and the proposed associated methodologies. The main aim of this review is to compile all available information on detection methodologies, providing at the same time valuable insights into the different approaches used for floating marine litter monitoring. First, a brief introduction into the theoretical basis of a spaceborne floating marine litter detection system is given. Next, published articles, or relevant research work have been compartmentalised, for analysing the proposed procedures and assisting in a further assessment of their methodological frameworks. Lastly, conclusions and bottlenecks of the existing knowledge on marine litter detection from space are derived. Although the remote detection of floating marine litter is currently limited by inherent restrictions of the available satellite sensors specifications, we highlight how the methodological processing chain can significantly affect the future accuracy of plastic detection from space."
986;"Visual quality assessment of malting barley using color, shape and texture descriptors";"Juan-Pablo Ramirez-Paredesa , Uriel-Haile Hernandez-Belmonteb,";"An essential part of the commercialization process of malting barley is the assessment of crop quality. While a traditional indicator of quality is the moisture content, visual inspection is normally carried out as well by an expert. Some indicators of sub-par crops are broken grains, contamination by foreign objects or other agricultural products, discoloration or abnormal pigmentation. We present a complete pipeline of vision and machine learning algorithms aimed at assessing the quality of malting barley grain. Previous solutions based on computer vision have solved this problem to varying degrees, and often require the grains under inspection to be clearly separated. We compare several feature vectors, combined with a nonlinear classifier. Our results show that the Local Phase Quantization descriptor, combined with color and shape features, provides the best results even against improved local descriptors like the Median Ternary Pattern or Median Robust Extended Local Binary Pattern. Our approach is fast, tolerates touching grains and provides an assessment that complies with local industry regulations."
987;Monitoring groundwater potential dynamics of north-eastern Bengal Basin in Bangladesh using AHP-Machine learning approaches;"Biplob Dey a , Kazi Al Muqtadir Abir a , Romel Ahmed a,* , Mohammed Abdus Salam b , Mohammad Redowan a , Md. Danesh Miah c , Muhammad Anwar Iqbal b";"Groundwater is a vital natural resource that plays a critical role in sustaining agriculture, forest ecosystems, industry, and household uses. However, due to natural and anthropogenic factors, groundwater is facing alarming declines. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the potential groundwater zones (PGWZ) in the northeastern Bengal Basin of Bangladesh between 1990 and 2021 using satellite images, public and field data pertaining to ten environmental parameters. The study utilized analytical hierarchy process to identify PGWZ and evaluated the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) algorithms (K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, XGBoost, decision tree, and random forest) for PGWZ classification. The findings indicated a decline in groundwater potential over the decades, which was categorized into five distinct zones based on the relative groundwater potential. The very high PGWZ decreased from 2.19% to 1.3%, and high PGWZ from 34.57% to 28.24%, while there was a sharp increase in the poor status of PGWZ (very low, low, and medium zones) over the same periods. The accuracy and kappa coefficients of the ground data validation for the estimated PGWZ map were 84.34% and 79.61%, respectively. According to accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score, five ML models are reliable predictors of PGWZ. RF achieved the highest accuracy of 92.33%, while XGBoost achieved an accuracy of 90.31%. Both models demonstrated superior prediction performance for PGWZ based on the normalized leverage factor. The study attributes the alteration of groundwater potential to changes in land use and land covers, increased land surface temperatures, decreased rainfall, and changes in soil erosion in the study region over the three decades. The results of this study offer valuable insights for decision-makers to make informed decisions for the sustainable and responsible management of groundwater resources."
988;Automatic thematic classification of election manifestos;"Suzan Verberne a,? , Eva Dhondt b , Antal van den Bosch b , Maarten Marx c";"We digitized three years of Dutch election manifestos annotated by the Dutch political scientist Isaac Lipschits. We used these data to train a classifier that can automatically label new, unseen election manifestos with themes. Having the manifestos in a uniform XML format with all paragraphs annotated with their themes has advantages for both electronic publishing of the data and diachronic comparative data analysis. The data that we created will be disclosed to the public through a search interface. This means that it will be possible to query the data and filter them on themes and parties. We optimized the Lipschits classifier on the task of classifying election manifestos using models trained on earlier years. We built a classifier that is suited for classifying election manifestos from 2002 onwards using the data from the 1980s and 1990s. We evaluated the results by having a domain expert manually assess a sample of the classified data. We found that our automatic classifier obtains the same precision as a human classifier on unseen data. Its recall could be improved by extending the set of themes with newly emerged themes. Thus when using old political texts to classify new texts, work is needed to link and expand the set of themes to newer topics."
989;Exploring the connection of physical habitat health of the wetland with its gas regulating services;"Swades Pal, Sandipta Debanshi *";"Many scholars assessed habitat health and measured gas regulation service of wetlands separately. However, no such targeted work was done to answer how habitat health can control gas regulation? Therefore, the present study investigated the role of habitat health on the gas regulation service of wetlands. Multi-parametric Machine Learning (ML) based modelling approach was applied to assess habitat health considering physical wetland hydrological factors and habitat degrading factors. Three primary atmospheric gas regulation functions of wetland, namely Methane (CH4) emission, Carbon (C) sequestration, and Oxygen (O2) release, were observed associating with habitat health. Very poor habitat health prevailed over 227 km2 of wetland, whereas very good habitat health covered 299 km2 of wetland. But out of the very good habitat health zone, 69% belonged to the perennial river of this region. On the other hand, it was estimated that the amount of annual CH4 emission, C sequestration, and O2 release from the wetlands of this region were respectively 8.01  1000 tons, 908.98  1000 tons and 664.51  1000 tons. The association of habitat health was positive with CH4 emission and negative with C sequestration and O2 release. Following the association, habitat health zone-wise variation of emission, sequestration, and release was also very prominent. The very good zone of habitat health was observed to have 60% higher CH4 average emission and 56% lesser C sequestration than very poor habitat health."
990;Amphibian species detection in water reservoirs using artificial neural networks for ecology-friendly city planning;Zehra Karapinar Senturk;"Planning cities regardless of natural resources has led to the existence of threats for several species that occupy an important place in local ecosystems. Constructing buildings, bridges, or motorways over water reservoirs is perilous for resident amphibians, which belong to one of the most fragile animal groups. An automated system that reliably identifies whether any amphibian species live in a water reservoir before construction in that region will help building inspectors during city planning and will ensure that citizens can enjoy the opportunities provided by nature. In this paper, an intelligent amphibian species detection system is developed using features extracted from GIS and satellite images. The presence of seven amphibian species is detected using an artificial neural network (ANN). Depending on the spatial features of the region, the proposed cascade-forward backpropagation neural network (CFBNN) model, a special type of ANN, determines which amphibian species live there to enable ecological precautions to be taken before construction starts and to preserve the biodiversity for the future health of the community. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms recently suggested strategies with more than 15% improvement on average. The performance of the system shows that the proposed detection approach can be a useful tool for smart and ecological city planning."
991;Conceptual prediction of harbor sedimentation quantities using AI approaches to support integrated coastal structures management;"Mohamed T. Elnabwya,b , Emad Elbeltagi b , Mahmoud M. El Bannaa , Mohamed Y. Elsheikhb , Ibrahim Motawa b , Jong Wan Huc,d,* , Mosbeh R. Kaloopd,e";"Sedimentation is one of the most critical environmental issues facing harbors authorities that results in significant maintenance and dredging costs. Thus, it is essential to plan and manage the harbors in harmony with both the environmental and economic aspects to support Integrated Coastal Structures Management (ICSM). Harbors layout and the permeability of protection structures like breakwaters affect the sediment transport within harbors basins. Using a multi-step relational research framework, this study aims to design a novel prediction model for estimating the sedimentation quantities in harbors through a comparative approach based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. First, one hundred simulations for different harbor layouts and various breakwater characteristics were numerically performed using a coastal modeling system (CMS) for generating the dataset to train and validate the proposed AIbased models. Second, three AI approaches namely: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were developed to predict sedimentation quantities. Third, a comparison between the developed models was conducted using quality assessment criteria to evaluate their performance and choose the best one. Fourth, a sensitivity analysis was performed to provide insights into the factors affecting sedimentation. Lastly, a decision support tool was developed to predict harbors sedimentation quantities. Results showed that the ANN model outperforms other models with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) equals 4%. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the main breakwater inclination angle, porosity, and harbor basin width affect significantly sediment transport. This research makes a significant contribution to the management of coastal structures by developing an AI data-driven framework that is beneficial for harbors authorities. Ultimately, the developed decision-support AI tool could be used to predict harbors sedimentation quantities in an easy, cheap, accurate, and practical manner compared to physical modeling which is time-consuming and costly."
992;Auditing fairness under unawareness through counterfactual reasoning;"Giandomenico Cornacchia a,* , Vito Walter Anelli a , Giovanni Maria Biancofiore a , Fedelucio Narducci a , Claudio Pomo a , Azzurra Ragone b , Eugenio Di Sciascio a";"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming the pivotal solution to support critical judgments in many life-changing decisions. In fact, a biased AI tool can be particularly harmful since these systems can contribute to or demote peoples well-being. Consequently, government regulations are introducing specific rules to prohibit the use of sensitive features (e.g., gender, race, religion) in the algorithms decision-making process to avoid unfair outcomes. Unfortunately, such restrictions may not be sufficient to protect people from unfair decisions as algorithms can still behave in a discriminatory manner. Indeed, even when sensitive features are omitted (fairness through unawareness), they could be somehow related to other features, named proxy features. This study shows how to unveil whether a black-box model, complying with the regulations, is still biased or not. We propose an end-to-end bias detection approach exploiting a counterfactual reasoning module and an external classifier for sensitive features. In detail, the counterfactual analysis finds the minimum cost variations that grant a positive outcome, while the classifier detects non-linear patterns of non-sensitive features that proxy sensitive characteristics. The experimental evaluation reveals the proposed methods efficacy in detecting classifiers that learn from proxy features. We also scrutinize the impact of state-of-the-art debiasing algorithms in alleviating the proxy feature problem."
993;Scenario evolutionary analysis for maritime emergencies using an ensemble belief rule base;"Baode Li , Jing Lu * , Jing Li , Xuebin Zhu , Chuan Huang , Wan Su";"Maritime emergencies exhibit uncertainty and complex evolution in the process of development. Scenario evolutionary analysis can identify the development of maritime emergencies, which is essential for an effective response. This paper proposes a novel ensemble belief rule base model (Ensemble-BRB) for scenario evolutionary analysis of maritime emergencies. Specifically, multiple low-dimensional random subspaces are generated randomly by combining mutual information so as to avoid combinatorial explosion, and to reduce the interference of redundant information. Subsequently, each random subspace is developed into a BRB subsystem that can be used to solve multiple-output problems, and the parameters of each BRB subsystem are learned using a differential evolutionary algorithm. Then, evidential reasoning is employed to combine the reasoning results of each BRB subsystem rule. Furthermore, the reasoning results of each BRB subsystem are combined using a cautious conjunctive rule approach to obtain the final results. The scenario evolutionary analysis of the proposed model is demonstrated and validated using maritime accidents as a case study, and the experimental results show that the proposed model can be effectively implemented. Moreover, in comparison with other well-known methods, the proposed method demonstrates good interpretability, high accuracy, and an effective solution for combinatorial explosion."

The search for quality protein is a challenge for aquaculture especially for the breeding, fattening, and slaughtering of fish ensuring environmental sustainability with strict management of resources and waste reduction. The main contribution of this research is in the development of a system for predicting the body biomass of live fingerlings and juveniles as an alternative to the traditional invasive estimation methods used by small and medium-sized fish farms. This paper provides an evaluation based on automatic frame selection with data augmentation by 10? rotation for biomass estimation of Pintado Real using video frames collected by a computer vision system that resulted in a new dataset called ALEV400P with 400 fingerlings ranging from approximately 1 to 32 grams. Three different deep learning frameworks were evaluated and also compared with five shallow learning algorithms. The results showed that the Deep Belief Network outperformed the others with R2 of 0.7 for batch 1. The combination of the automatic frame selection strategy by Euclidean distance from head to tail with data augmentation by 10-degree rotation optimized the prediction result using a dataset with high variability of fingerling sizes."
995;"Spatial dimensions of dichotomous adaptive responses to natural hazards in coastal districts of West Bengal, India";"Subhas Bera * , Arup Das, Taraknath Mazumder";"Developing countries continue to reel under the impact of hydro meteorological disasters which have been aggravated by climate change. Communities exposed to such vagaries of nature continuously strive to adapt to such events. These adaptive practices can be traced spatially through transformations in Land Use Land Cover (LULC). This study hypothesizes that these spatial transformations are a function of the spatial manifestation due to changes in livelihood practices resulting from exposure to natural hazards. Moreover, the spatial dimensions of changes observed are dichotomous in nature and express themselves differently based on local stimuli. LULC transformations between the period 20022014, along with socio-economic data and semi-structured interviews were used to identify the drivers of LULC changes in coastal districts of West Bengal, India. In this study, evidence of transformations triggered by natural hazards are differently expressed for zone in proximity to coastal areas and zone in proximity to a primate metropolitan area. Results from the analyses show three predominant changes - increasing trends from agriculture to aquaculture practices in coastal tidal influence Blocks (270.39%), trends of rapid urbanization, and increases of the built-up (rural) area in Blocks adjoining the metropolitan area (58.18%). Statistical analyses revealed that the changes in the area under aquaculture can be attributed to change in area under agriculture practice and accessibility to a station of suburban railway network. Similarly, for Blocks in the rural areas, it was observed that the change in the built-up area can be explained by existing built-up area/fallow land and its distance from the district headquarter."

Jueal Mia b , Mohammad Shorif Uddin a , Farruk Ahmed c";"Bangladesh extensively depends on agriculture for the economy as well as food security owing to its huge population. In this connection, it becomes very important to efficiently grow plants and increase their yields. Quantity and quality of fruits can be degraded having attacked by various diseases. It is a matter of fact that not even a single research work has been conducted for automated recognition of jackfruit diseases to facilitate those distant farmers who need proper cultivation support. Presuming that our context is the recognition of jackfruit diseases, two challenging problems are mainly raised, i.e. detection of diseases and classification of diseases. In this research, we perform an in-depth investigation of an agromedical expert system, which proceeds with a digital image acquired with a cellphone or other handheld device and recognizes the disease. Exhaustive experiments have been performed to assess the feasibility of our intended expert system. At first, a discriminatory feature set is selected. k-means clustering segmentation is put into action to detect disease-affected regions of an image of a disease-attacked jackfruit and extract the features from these regions. Then classification of the diseases is accomplished by using nine off-the-shelf classification algorithms in order to thoroughly assess the merits of the classifiers in the index of seven prominent performance metrics. Random forest is found outperforming all other classifiers to the amount of all metrics used by attaining an accuracy approaching to 90%. On the contrary, logistic regression shows not only the poorest result of an accuracy approaching to 75% but also some other poorest metric-values."

The accurate prediction of the severity of oil spill is of great importance in order to determine the accurate response methods. In this perspective, this study aims to predict the severity of oil spill in possible vessel accidents by examining data based on vessel accidents that cause marine pollution. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) database covering 2002-2015 was utilized and a total of 1468 instances of vessel involved accidents leading oil spill were analysed using Decision Tree (DT) and data-driven Bayesian Networks (BN) called Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN). As a result, the most important contributing factors affecting the severity of oil spill were revealed as type of accident and type of vessel. This study would be a guide that will assist authorities and policymakers in predicting the severity of oil spill, and contribute to the development of important strategies and countermeasures for vessel accidents leading oil spills."
998;Predicting sea surface salinity in a tidal estuary with machine learning;"Nicolas Guilloua,* , Georges Chapalaina , Sbastien Pettonb";"As an indicator of exchanges between watersheds, rivers and coastal seas, salinity may provide valuable information about the exposure, ecological health and robustness of marine ecosystems, including especially estuaries. The temporal variations of salinity are traditionally approached with numerical models based on a physical description of hydrodynamic and hydrological processes. However, as these models require large computational resources, such an approach is, in practice, rarely considered for rapid turnaround predictions as requested by engineering and operational applications dealing with the ecological monitoring of estuaries. As an alternative efficient and rapid solution, we investigated here the potential of machine learning algorithms to mimic the non-linear complex relationships between salinity and a series of input parameters (such as tide-induced free-surface elevation, river discharges and wind velocity). Beyond regression methods, the attention was dedicated to popular machine learning approaches including MultiLayer Perceptron, Support Vector Regression and Random Forest. These algorithms were applied to six-year observations of sea surface salinity at the mouth of the Elorn estuary (bay of Brest, western Brittany, France) and compared to predictions from an advanced ecological numerical model. In spite of simple input data, machine learning algorithms reproduced the seasonal and semi-diurnal variations of sea surface salinity characterised by noticeable tide-induced modulations and low-salinity events during the winter period. Support Vector Regression provided the best estimations of surface salinity, improving especially predictions from the advanced numerical model during low-salinity"

This paper provides an overview of the research progress of computer vision techniques in detecting abnormal fish over the past two decades. For the first time, the abnormal fish detection task is divided into three external manifestations: abnormal physiological activities, abnormal trajectories, and abnormal surface features of fish. The traditional methods and deep learning methods in computer vision technology are further summarized for their application approaches in these three research types, and the commonly used classical algorithm models in abnormal fish detection are introduced comprehensively. In addition, this paper summarizes several common methods for obtaining public datasets in aquaculture and evaluation indicators of model accuracy, emphasizing two methods for researchers to collect experimental on-site data. Finally, based on the above work, this paper analyzes several challenges in abnormal fish detection, proposes feasible strategies for each challenge, and notes the importance of improving models to effectively integrate and analyze data from multiple platforms.

1000;Predicting Temperature of Major Cities Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning;"Wasiou Jaharabia,*, MD Ibrahim Al Hossaina , Rownak Tahmida , Md. Zuhayer Islama , T.M. Saad Rayhana , Arif Shakilb";"Currently, the issue that concerns the world leaders most is climate change for its effect on agriculture, environment and economies of daily life. So, to combat this, temperature prediction with strong accuracy is vital. So far, the most effective widely used measure for such forecasting is Numerical weather prediction (NWP) which is a mathematical model that needs broad data from different applications to make predictions. This expensive, time and labor consuming work can be minimized through making such predictions using Machine learning algorithms. Using the database made by University of Dayton which consists the change of temperature in major cities we used the Time Series Analysis method where we use LSTM for the purpose of turning existing data into a tool for future prediction. LSTM takes the long-term data as well as any short-term exceptions or anomalies that may have occurred and calculates trend, seasonality and the stationarity of a data. By using models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet with the concept of RNN and LSTM we can, filter out any abnormalities, preprocess the data compare it with previous trends and make a prediction of future trends. Also, seasonality and stationarity help us analyze the reoccurrence or repeat over one year variable and removes the constrain of time in which the data was dependent so see the general changes that are predicted. By doing so we managed to make prediction of the temperature of different cities during any time in future based on available data and built a method of accurate prediction. This document contains our methodology for being able to make such predictions"
1001;A Hybrid Deep Learning-based Approach for Optimal Genotype by Environment Selection;"Zahra Khalilzadeh, Motahareh Kashanian, Saeed Khaki, Lizhi Wang";"Accurately predicting crop yield is vital for enhancing agricultural breeding and ensuring crop production remains resilient in diverse climatic conditions. Integrating weather data throughout the crop growing season, especially for various genotypes, is crucial for these predictions. It represents a significant stride in comprehending how climate change affects a varietys adaptability. In the MLCAS2021 Crop Yield Prediction Challenge, the Third International Workshop on Machine Learning for Cyber-Agricultural Systems released a dataset for soybean hybrids consisting of 93,028 training performance records to predict yield for the 10,337 testing performance records. This dataset spanned 159 locations across 28 states in the U.S. and Canadian provinces over a 13-year period, from 2003 to 2015. It comprised details on 5838 distinct genotypes and daily weather data for a 214-day growing season, encompassing all possible location and year combinations. As one of the winning teams, we designed two novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The first proposed model combines CNN and fully-connected (FC) neural networks (CNN-DNN model). The second proposed model adds an LSTM layer at the end of the CNN part for the weather variables (CNNLSTM-DNN model). The Generalized Ensemble Method (GEM) was then utilized to determine the optimal weights of the proposed CNN-based models to achieve higher accuracy than other baseline models. The GEM model we introduced demonstrated superior performance compared to all other baseline models employed in soybean yield prediction. It exhibited a lower RMSE ranging from 5.55% to 39.88%, a reduced MAE ranging from 5.34% to 43.76%, and a higher correlation coefficient ranging from 1.1% to 10.79% in comparison to the baseline models when evaluated on test data."
1002;A systematic review of the use of Deep Learning in Satellite Imagery for Agriculture;"Brandon Victora,* , Zhen Hea and Aiden Nibalia";"Agricultural research is essential for increasing food production to meet the requirements of an increasing population in the coming decades. Recently, satellite technology has been improving rapidly and deep learning has seen much success in generic computer vision tasks and many application areas which presents an important opportunity to improve analysis of agricultural land. Here we present a systematic review of 150 studies to find the current uses of deep learning on satellite imagery for agricultural research. Although we identify 5 categories of agricultural monitoring tasks, the majority of the research interest is in crop segmentation and yield prediction. We found that, when used, modern deep learning methods consistently outperformed traditional machine learning across most tasks the only exception was that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks did not consistently outperform Random Forests (RF) for yield prediction. The reviewed studies have largely adopted methodologies from generic computer vision, except for one major omission: benchmark datasets are not utilised to evaluate models across studies, making it difficult to compare results. Additionally, some studies have specifically utilised the extra spectral resolution available in satellite imagery, but other divergent properties of satellite images - such as the hugely different scales of spatial patterns - are not being taken advantage of in the reviewed studies."
